The feasibility of m

s
cenarios
Scenarios provide internally consistent projections of emission reduction drivers and help contextualize
the scale of deployment and interactions of mitigation strategies. Recent research has proposed and
operationali
s
ed frameworks
for the
feasibility asse
ssment of mitigation scenarios.
I
n this report
t
he
feasibility assessment of scenarios
uses
an approach that involves developing a set of multi
-
dimensional
metrics capturing the
timing
,
disruptiveness
and the
scale
of the transformative change within five
dimensions:
geophysical, technological, economic, socio
-
cultural and institutional
,
as illustrated in
B
ox TS.1

Figure 1
.
More than 20 indicators were chosen to represent feasibility dimensions that could be related to scenario
metrics. Thresholds of feasibility risks of different intensity

were
obtained through empirical analysis
of historical data
and
assessed l
iterature
. D

A wide range of factors have been found to enable sustainability transitions, ranging from
technological innovations to shifts in markets, and
from policies and governance arrangements
to shifts in belief systems and market forces
(
high confidence
).
Many of these factors
have
come
together in a co
-
evolutionary process that has unfolded globally, internationally and locally over several
decades (
l
ow evidence, high agreement
). Those same conditions that may serve to impede the transition
(i.e., organi
s
ational structure, behaviour, technological lock
-
in) can also ‘flip’ to enable both
the
transition
and the framing of sustainable development policies
to create a stronger basis
for
policy
support
(
high confidence
).
It is important to note that strong shocks to these systems, including
accelerating climate change impacts, economic crises and political changes, may provide crucial
openings for accelerated transitions to sustainable systems. For example, re
-
building mor
e sustainably
after an extreme event, or renewed public debate about the drivers of social and economic vulnerability
to multiple stressors
(medium
confidence
)
.

While transition pathways will vary across
countries
it is anticipated that t
hey
will
b
e challenging
in many contexts (
high confidence
).
Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable
production and consumption patterns, as well as governance arrangements and political economic
institutions that lock in resource
-
intensive developme
nt patterns
(
high confidence
).
Resource shortages,
social divisions, inequitable distributions of wealth, poor infrastructure and limited access to advanced
