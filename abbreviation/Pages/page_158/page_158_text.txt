Carbon Capture and Utili
s
ation (CCU) applied to fossil CO
2
do not count as removal technologies. CCS
and CCU can only be part of CDR methods if th
e CO
2
is biogenic or directly captured from ambient
air, and stored durably in geo
logical reservoirs or products
.

There is a great variety of CDR methods and respective implementation options

. Some of these methods (like afforestation and soil
-
carbon sequestration) have
been
practiced for decades to millennia, although not necessarily with the intention to remove carbon
from the atmosphere. Conversely, for methods such as DACCS and
BECCS, experience is growing but
still limited in scales. A categori
s
ation of CDR methods can be
based on several criteria, depending on
the highlighted characteristics. In this report
,
the categori
s
ation is focused on the role of CDR methods
in the carbon
cycle
,
i.e. on the removal process (
land
-
based biological
;
ocean
-
based biological
;
geochemical
;
chemical
) and on the timescale of storage (
decades to centuries
;
centuries to millennia
;
10 thousand years or longer
), the latter being closely linked to different carbon storage media. Within
one category (e.g., ocean
-
based biological CDR) options often
differ with respect to other dynamic or
context
-
specific dimensions such as mitigation potential, cost, potential for co
-
benefits and adverse
side
-
effects, and technology readiness level
.

It is useful to
distinguish between CO
2
removal from the atmosphere as
the
outcome of deliberate
activities implementing CDR options, and the net emissions outcome achieved with the help of CDR
deployment (i.e., gross emissions minus gross removals). As part of ambitious
mitigation strategies at
global or national levels, gross CDR can fulfil three different roles in complementing emissions
abatement: (1) lowering net CO
2
or GHG emissions in the near
-
term; (2) counterbalancing ‘hard
-
to
-
abate’ residual emissions like CO
2
fr
om industrial activities and long
-
distance transport, or
CH
4
and
nitrous oxide from agriculture, in order to help reach net
zero CO
2
or GHG emissions in the mid
-
term;
(3) achieving net
negative CO
2
or GHG emissions in the long
-
term if deployed at levels e
xceeding
annual residual emissions
{
2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
}
. These roles of CDR are not mutually exclusive: for
example, achieving net
zero CO
2
or GHG emissions globally might involve individual developed
countries attaining net
negative CO
2
emissions at the t
ime of global net
zero, thereby allowing
developing countries a smoother transition
