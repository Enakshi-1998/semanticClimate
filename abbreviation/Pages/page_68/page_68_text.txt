Since the IPCC’s Fifth
Assessment Report (AR5), important changes that have emerged include
the specific objectives established in the Paris Agreement of 2015 (for temperature, adaptation
and finance), rising climate impacts, and higher levels of societal awareness and support f
or
climate action
(
high confidence
).
Meeting the long
-
term temperature
goal
in the Paris Agreement
,
however,
implies a rapid
inflection in
GHG
emission trends and
accelerating
decline towards ‘net zero’
.
This is
implausible without
urgent and
ambitious action at all scales. {1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, Chapters 3 and
4}
Effective and equitable climate policies are largely compatible with the broader goal of
sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty as enshrined in the
UN
2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and its
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notwithstanding
trade
-
offs in some cases
(
high confidence
).
Taking
urgent
action to combat climate change and its
impacts
is one of the
17
SDGs
(SDG13)
.
However, c
limate
change
mitigation
also
has synergies and/or
trade
-
offs with many other SDGs. There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG
emissions, as historically both per capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation.
However, recent evi
dence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions.
Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their
respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emi
ssions contributions,
degree of
vulnerabilit
y
and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice
are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international
support for deep decarboni
sation.
Achieving sustainable
development and eradicating poverty would
involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale.
Failure to address
questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion an
d stability. International co
-
operation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of
sustainable development
pathways towards fulfilling the
SDGs
are illustrated in Figure TS.1.
