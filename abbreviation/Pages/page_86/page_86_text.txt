Panel a
shows the distribution of regional GHG emissions
in tonnes CO

-
eq per
capita
by
region
in 2019.
GHG emissions are categorised into:
CO
2
Fossil fuel and industry (CO
2
-
FFI), CO
2
Land use, land use change, forestry (CO
2
-
LULUCF) and other
GHG e
missions
(

gas,
expressed in CO

-
eq using GWP

).
The height
of each rectangle shows
per
-
capita
emissions, the width shows
the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions for each
regiona
l
.
Percentages refer to
overall GHG
contributions
to total global emissions in 2019.
Emissions from
international aviation and shipping are not included.
Panel b
shows the share of historical net CO
2
emissions per region from 1850 to 2019.
This includes CO
2
-
FFI
and CO
2
-
LULUCF (GtCO
2
).
Other GHG emissions are not included. Emissions from international aviation and
shipping are
included.
{1.3, Figure 1.2a, 2.2, Figure 2.10}
Globally, GHG emissions continued to rise across all sectors and subsectors
, and
most rapidly in
transport and industry
(
high confidence
)
.
In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO
2
-
eq) of global GHG emissions
came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO
2
-
eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO
2
-
eq) from
a
griculture,
forestry and other land use (
AFOLU
)
, 15%
(8.7 GtCO
2
-
eq) from transport
,
and 5.6% (3.3 GtCO
2
-
eq)
from buildings. Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered, the relative shares of industry
and buildings emissions rise to 34% and 17%, respectively. Average annual GHG emissions growth
du
ring 2010
-
2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and
industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%, direct emissions only), but remained roughly constant at about 2% per
year in the transport sector
(high confidence)
.
Emission growt
h in AFOLU is more uncertain due to the
high share of CO
2
-
LULUCF emissions.

There is a discrepancy, equating to 5.5 GtCO
2
yr
-
1
, between alternative methods of accounting for
anthropogenic land CO
2
fluxes.
Accounting for this discrepancy would assist
in assessing
collective progress in a global stocktake (
high confidence
).
The principal accounting approaches are
National GHG inventories (NGHGI) and global modelling
9
approaches. NGHGI, based on IPCC
guidelines, consider a much larger area of forest to be under human management than global models.
NGHGI consider the fluxes due to human
-
induced environmental change on this area to be
anthropogenic and are thus reported. Global models, in contrast, cons
ider these fluxes to be natural and
are excluded from the total reported anthropogenic land CO
2
flux
.
The accounting method used will
affect the assessment of collective progress in a global stocktake

(

).
In the absence of these adjustments,
allowing a like with like comparison,
collective progress would appear better than it is.

This accounting discrepancy also applies to
I
ntegrated Assessment M
odels
(IAMs)
, with the
consequence that
ant
hropogenic land CO
2
fluxes
reported
in IAM
pathways
cannot be compared
directly with those reported in national GHG
inventories (
high confidence
).
Methodologies
enabling a more like
-
for
-
like comparison between models’ and countries’ approaches would
support
more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved under the Paris Agreement. {3.4,
7.2.2}
Average annual growth in GHG emissions from energy supply decreased from 2.3% for 2000
–
2009 to 1.0% for 2010
–
2019 (
high confidence
).
This slowing
of growth is attributable to further
improvements in energy efficiency and
reductions
in the carbon intensity of energy supply
driven
by
fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity,
particularly in Eastern Asia
, and
the increased us
e of renewables (
medium confidence
).

T
he industry, buildings and transport sectors make up 44% of global GHG emissions, or 66%
when the emissions from electricity and heat production are reallocated as
indirect emissions
(
high
confidence
).
This reallocation makes a substantial difference to ov
erall
industry and buildings
