A broad class of
more
speculative technologies
propose to counteract effects of climate change
by
remov
ing
CO
2
from the atmosphere
(CDR)
,
or directly modify the Earth’s energy balance at a large scale
(SRM)
.
CDR technologies
include ocean iron fertilisation, enhanced weather
ing and ocean alkalinisation
(Council
2015a)
,
a
long with Direct Air Capture
with Carbon Storage
(
DAC
CS
).
They
could
potentially draw down
atmospheric CO
2
much faster than
the Earth’s natural carbon cycle
,
and reduce reliance on biomass

based
removal
(Realmonte et al. 2019; Köberle 2019)
,
but some
present novel risks to the e
nvironment
and
DAC
CS
is
currently more expensive than
most
other forms of mitigation
(Fuss et al. 2018;

.
Solar radiation modification
(
SRM
) could potentially
cool the planet
rapidly
at low
estimated direct costs by reflecting incoming sunlight
(Council 2015b)
, but
entails uncertain side effects
and thorny international equity and governance challenges
(Netra et al. 2018; Florin et al. 2020; National
Academies of Sciences 2021)
(
Chapter 14
)
.
Understanding the climate response to SRM remains subject
to large uncertainties (AR6 WG1).
Some literature uses t
he term “geoengineering”
for
both
CDR or SRM
when
applied at a planetary scale
(Shepherd
2009; GESAMP 2019)
. In this report, CDR and SRM are
discussed separately reflecting their
very
different geophysical characteristics.
Large improvements in information storage, processing, and communication technologies, including
artificial intellige
nce, will affect emissions.
T
hey can enhance energy
-
efficient control, reduce transaction
cost for energy production and distribution, improve demand
-
side management
(Raza and Khosravi 2015)
,
and reduce the need for physical transport
(Smidfelt Rosqvist and Winslott Hiselius 2016; see Chapters 5,
6, 9
-

. However
,
d
ata centres and related IT systems (including blockchain), are electricity
-
intensive
and
will raise demand for energy
(Avgerinou et al. 2017)
-
cryptocurrencies may be a major global source of
CO
2
if the electricity production is not decarbonised
(Mora et al. 2018)
–
and there is also a concern that
information technologies can compound and exacerbate current inequalities
(
C
hapter 16; Box
2
).
IT
may
affect broader patterns of work and leisure
(Boppart and Krusell 2020)
, and
t
he emissions in
tensity of how
people spend their leisure time will become more important (see
C
hapters 5, 9). Because higher efficiency
tends to reduces costs, it often involves some ‘rebound’ offsetting at least some of the emission savings
(Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Sudbury and Hutchinson 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019)
.
Technology can
enable
both emissions reductions and/or increased emissions
(Chapter 16)
. Governments
play an important r
ole in most major innovations
, in both ‘technology
-
push’
(Mazzucato 2013)
and induced
by ‘demand
-
pull’
(Grubb et al. 2021a)
,
so policy is important in determining its pace, direction, and
utilisation
(Roberts and Geels 2019a;
S
ections 1.7.1, 1.7.3)
. Overall, the challenge will be to enhance the
synergies and minimise the trade
-
offs and rebounds, including taking account of ethical and distributional
dimensions
(Gonella et al. 2019)
.
1.4.4
Finance and investment
Finance is both an enabler and constraint on mitigation, and s
ince AR5,
attention to
the financial sector
’s
role in
mitiga
tion
has grown
. This is partly in the context of the Paris Agreement finance articles and Green
Climate Fund, the pledge to mobilise USD
100bn/yr by 2020, and the Addis Abbaba Action Agenda
(
S
ection 1.3.1). However
t
here
is a persistent but uncertain gap in mitigation finance
(Cui and Huang
2018)
;
(Table 15.15.1), even though tracked climate finance overwhelmingly goes toward mitigation
compared to adaptation
(UNEP 2020; 15.3; Working Group II)
. Green bond issuance has increased recentl
y
in parallel with efforts to reform the international financial system by supporting development of local
capital markets (15.6.4).
Climate finance is a multi
-
actor, multi
-
objective domain that includes central banks, commercial banks,
asset managers, un
derwriters, development banks, and corporate planners. Climate change presents both
