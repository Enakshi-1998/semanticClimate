but
the extent to which SDGs and
economic growth expectations can be fulfilled while decoupling GHG emissions
remains
a concern
(Hickel and Kallis 2020; Haberl et al. 2020)

Below some thresholds of absolute poverty, more

In conclusion, achieving climate stabilisation in the context of sustainable development and efforts to
eradicate poverty requires collective action and exploiting synergies between climate action and
sustainable development, while minimising the impact of

considerations to a

to cut emissions

This is ever

Four Analytic Frameworks
for understanding
mitigation response
strategies
Climate change is unprecedented in its scope (sectors, actors and countries), depth (major
transformations) and timescales (over generations). As such, it creates unique challenges for analysis.
It has been called “the greatest market failure in history”
(Stern 2007)
; the Perfect Moral Storm
(Gardiner 2006)
and a “super wicked problem”
(Lazarus 2009; Levin et al. 2012)

To complement the extensive literature on risks and decision

WGII (notably, Chapter 19), t
his section summarises insights and developments in key a
nalytic
frameworks and tools
particularly relevant to understanding specific mitigation strategies, policies and
other actions, including explaining the observed if limited progress to date. O

in the quotes above

ethical
perspectives

frameworks which focus on the processes and actors involve

major technological and social transitions.
T
hese need to be complemented by a fourth
set of approaches
which shine more light on
psychological

and political
factors.
A
ll these frameworks are
relevant, and together they point to the multiple perspectives and actions required if the positive drivers
of emission reduction summarised in section
4
are to outweigh the barriers and overcome the
constraints.

Aggregated approac
hes:
economic
efficiency
and
global
dynamics
of mitigation
Some of the most established and influential approaches to understand
aggregate
causes and
consequences of climate change and mitigation across societies, draw upon economic theories and
modelling
to generate global emission pathways in the absence of climate policies (a reference) and to
study alternative mitigation pathways (described in detail in
Section 3.2.

Chapter 3). The underlying
economic concepts aggregate wealth or other measures of
welfare based on utilitarian ethical
