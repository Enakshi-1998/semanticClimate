Accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other
sources is a critical enabler to enhance mitigation action and address inequities in access to finance,
including its costs, terms and conditions and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing
countries (
high confidence
). Scaled-up public grants for mitigation and adaptation funding for
vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and have high social
returns in terms of access to basic energy (
high confidence
). Options for scaling up mitigation in
developing regions include: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance
flows from developed to developing countries in the context of the USD100 billion-a-year goal; increase
the use of public guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost; local capital
markets development; and building greater trust in international cooperation processes (

A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable and increased flows
of financing over the next decade can accelerate climate action, including in developing regions and
countries facing high debt costs, debt distress and macro-economic uncertainty (
high confidence
).

E.5.4
Clear signalling by governments and the international community, including a stronger
alignment of public sector finance and policy, and higher levels of public sector climate finance, reduces
uncertainty and transition risks for the private sector. Depending on national contexts, investors and
financial intermediaries, central banks, and financial regulators can support climate action and can shift
the systemic underpricing of climate climate-related risk by increasing awareness, transparency and
consideration of climate-related risk, and investment opportunities. Financial flows can also be aligned
with funding needs through: greater support for technology development; a continued role for
multilateral and national climate funds and development banks; lowering financing costs for
underserved groups through entities such as green banks existing in some countries, funds and risk-
sharing mechanisms; economic instruments which consider economic and social equity and
distributional impacts; gender-responsive and women-empowerment programs as well as enhanced
access to finance for local communities and Indigenous Peoples and small landowners; and greater
public-private cooperation. (

International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change
mitigation goals
.
The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are supporting rising
levels of national ambition and encouraging development and implementation of climate policies,
although gaps remain. Partnerships, agreements, institutions and initiatives operating at the sub-
global and sectoral levels and engaging multiple actors are emerging, with mixed levels of
effectiveness. (

E.6.1
Internationally agreed processes and goals, such as those in the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and
Paris Agreement, including transparency requirements for national reporting on emissions, actions and
support, and tracking progress towards the achievement of nationally determined contributions, are
enhancing international cooperation, national ambition and policy development. International financial,
technology and capacity building support to developing countries will enable greater implementation
and encourage ambitious nationally determined contributions over time. (

International cooperation on technology development and transfer accompanied by capacity
building, knowledge sharing, and technical and financial support can accelerate the global diffusion of
mitigation technologies, practices and policies at national and sub-national levels, and align these with
