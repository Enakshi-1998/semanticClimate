comes from the conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems
(coastal wetlands, peatlands, savannas and grasslands), with reduced deforestation in tropical regions

carbon sequestration in agriculture, the latter includes soil carbon management in croplands and

O emissions, and free-up land for reforestation and
restoration, and the producing of renewable energy. The improved and expanded use of wood products
sourced from sustainably managed forests also has potential through the allocation of harvested wood
to longer-lived products, increasing recycling or material substitution. AFOLU mitigation measures
cannot compensate for delayed emission reductions in other sectors. Persistent and region-specific
barriers continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation
options. Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve significant mitigation (

: ‘Sustainable healthy diets’ promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and
wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable;
and are culturally acceptable, as described in FAO and WHO. The related concept of balanced diets
refers to diets that feature plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes, fruits and
vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low-GHG
emission systems, as described in SRCCL.
C.9.2
AFOLU carbon sequestration and GHG emission reduction options have both co-benefits and
risks in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, food and water security, wood supply,
livelihoods and land tenure and land-use rights of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and small
land owners. Many options have co-benefits but those that compete for land and land-based resources
can pose risks. The scale of benefit or risk largely depends on the type of activity undertaken,
deployment strategy (e.g., scale, method), and context (e.g., soil, biome, climate, food system, land
ownership) that vary geographically and over time. Risks can be avoided when AFOLU mitigation is
pursued in response to the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes that
maximize co-benefits while limiting trade-offs. (
