technological and societal trends.
They can
also be reduced by putting in place appropriate enabling
conditions
.
Figure TS.3

highlights the dynamic and transient nature of feasibility risks. These risks are
transient and
concentrated in the decades before
mid
-
century.
Figure TS.3

also
illustrates how
different
feasibility
dimensions pose differentiated challenges: for example, institutional feasibility challenges
are shown as
unprecedented
for a high proportion of scenarios
, in line with the qualitative l
iterature
,
but
moving from 2030 to
2050 and 2100
these challenges decre
ase
.
The feasibility challenges associated with m
itigation pathways are
predominantly
institutional
and
economic
rather than
technological
and
geophysical
(medium confidence)
.
The rapid pace of
technological development and deployment in mitigation
scenarios is not incompatible with historical
records
, but r
ather
, i
nstitutional capacity is a key limiting factor for a successful transition. Emerging
economie
s appear to have highest
feasibility challenges in the short
-
to medium
-
term.
This suggests
a
key role of policy and technology as enabling factors.

Pathways relying on a broad portfolio of mitigation strategies are
more
robust and
resilient (
high
confidence
).
Portfolios of technological solutions reduce the feasibility risks associated with the
low
carbon transition.
