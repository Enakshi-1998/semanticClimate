literatures identify three main levels with different characteristics, most generally termed micro, meso
and macro. Transitions can be accelerated by policies appropriately target
ed, which may be similarly
grouped
and sequenced (upper panel)
in terms of corresponding three pillars of policy (Section 1.7.
3
);
generally all are relevant, but their relative importance differs according to stage of the transition.
Technological Innov
ation Systems
(TIS)
framework
s
(
chapter 16.4
)
focus on processes and policies of
early innovation and ‘emergence’, which combine experimentation and commercialisation, involving
Strategic Niche Management
(Rip and Kemp 1998; Geels and Raven 2006)
.
Literatures on the wider
processes of transition highlight
different
stages (eg.

in
Chapter 16
)
and
scales
across three main levels, most general
ly
term
ed
micro, meso and macro
(Rotmans et al. 2001)
.
T
he
widely
-
used
‘
Multi
-
Level Perspective’
or MLP
(Geels 2002)
identifies the
meso
-
level
as the
established
‘
socio
-
technical
(ST)
regime’
,
an set of
interrelated sub
-
systems
which define
rules and
regulatory structures
around existing
technologies and practices
. T
he micro level is an
ecosystem of
varied niche alternatives
, and o
verlaying the ST regime is a macro ‘landscape’ level
. T
ransitions often
start with niche alternatives
(Köhler et al. 2019; Grin et al. 2010)
, which
may
break through to wider
diffusion
(second stage
in Figure 1.
8
), especially
if external landscape developments ‘create pressures
on the regime that lead to cracks, tensions and windows of opportunity’
(Geels 2010; Rotmans et al.
2001)
; an example is climate change putting sustained pressure on current regimes of energy production
and consumption
(Kuzemko et al. 2016)
.
There are continual interact
ions between landscape, regime
and niches
, with varied implications for
Transition Management
(Loorbach 2010; Rotmans et al. 2001)
.
In contrast to standard economic metrics of marginal or smooth change (e.g. elasticities), transition
theories
emphasise interdisciplinary approach
es
and
the
non
-
linear dynamics, social, economic and
environmental aspects of transitions to sustainability
(Köhler et al. 2018; Cherp et al. 2018)
.
Th
is may
explain persistent tendencies to underestimate the exponential pace of change now being observed in
renewable
electricity
(
Chapters
2, 6) and emerging in mobility (
Chapter
10).
Recent
decades have seen
parallel
broadening of economic perspectives an
d theories.
Building also on
the New Institutional Economics literatures
(Williamson 2000)
,
Grubb et al.
(2015)
classify these into
three ‘domains of economic decision
-
making’
associate
d
with different branches of economic theory,
respectively (1)
behavioural and organisational
; (2)
neoclassical and welfare
, and (3)
evolutionary and
institutional
.
Like MLP, t
hese
are related to
different social and temporal scales,
as applied also in
studying the
‘
adaptive finance’
in UK electricity transition
(Hall et al. 2017)
.
There are significant
differences but these approaches all
point to understanding the characteristics of different actors,
notably,
individuals/
local actors
; larger corporate organisations (public or private); and (mainly) public
authorities,
each with different
decision
-
making
characteristics
.
Sustainability
ma
y require
purposeful actions at the different levels to foster the growth of sustainable
technologies and practices
, including support for
niche alternatives
(Grin et al. 2010)
.
The middle
level
(established ‘socio
-
technical regime’) tends to resist major change
, reforms generally involve
pressures
from the other two levels.
Thus, t
ransitions can be accelerated by policies appropriately target
ing
relevant actors at the different levels
(Köhler et al. 2019)
,
the foundations for “three pilla
rs of policy”
(Grubb et al. 2014)
, which logically evolve in the course of transition (
Figure 2.
6a).
I
ncumbent
industries have to ada
pt if they are to thrive within the growth of new systems.
Policy may need to
balance existing socio
-
technical systems with strategic investment and institutional development of the
emerging niches (e.g. the maintenance of energy provision and energy secur
ity with the development
of renewables)
,
and
help
manage declin
ing
industries
(Koasidis et al. 2020)
