A harmonised approach to
assessing feasibility
The
assessment
of
feasibility
in this report
aims to identify barriers and enablers
to
the deployment of
mitigation options and pathways. The assessment organises evidence to support
policy
decision
s
, and
decisions on actions,
that would improve
the feasibility of mitigation options and pathways by removing
relevant barriers and by strength
ening enablers of change.
The f
easibility of mitigation response options
Mitigation response options are
assess
ed against
six dimensions of feasibility
. E
ach dimension
compris
es
a key set of indicators that can be evaluated by
combining various strands of
literature
.

Table.1: Feasibility dimensions and indicators to assess the barriers and enablers of
implementing mitigation options
Feasibility dimension
Indicators
Geophysical feasibility
Availability of required geophysical resources:
•
Physical potential
•
Geophysical resource availability
•
Land use
Environmental
-
ecological
Impacts on environment:
feasibility
•
Air pollution
•
Toxic waste, ecotoxicity and eutrophication
•
Water quantity and quality
•
Biodiversity
Technological feasibility
Extent to which the technology
can
be implemented at scale
soon
•
Simplicity
•
Technology scalability
•
Maturity and
technology readiness
Economic feasibility
Financial costs and economic effects
•
Costs now, in 2030 and in the long term
•
Employment effects
and economic growth
Socio
-
cultural feasibility
Public engagement and support, and social impacts:
•
Public acceptance
•
Effects on health and well
-
being
•
Distributional effects
Institutional feasibility
Institutional conditions that affect
the implementation of the response
option
•
Political acceptance
•
Institutional capacity
and governance, cross
-
sectoral coordination
•
Legal and administrative capacity
The
assessment
–
undertaken by the
sectoral chapters in this report
–
evaluates
to what extent
each
indicator
(
listed
in Box TS.
1

Table.1
)
would be
an
enabler or barrier to implementation using
a scoring
methodology
(
described in detail in
Annex II Part IV Section 1
1
).
When appropriate, it is
also
indicated
whether the feasibility of an option varies across context, scale, time and temperature goal.
The resulting
scores
provide insight into
the extent to which each feasibility dimension enables or inhibits the
deployment
of the relevant option
. It also
provides insight into
the nature of the
effort needed to reduce
or remove barriers
thereby improving
the feasibility of
individual
option
s
.
