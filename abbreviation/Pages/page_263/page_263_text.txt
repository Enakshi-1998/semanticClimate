). Ongoing GHG

intensive investments,
including those
from
basic industrialisation in poorer countries, are adding to this.
The fact that investors anticipate a level of fossil fuel use that is
not compatible with severe climate
constraints creates a clear risk of ‘
stranded assets’
facing these investors
(

),
and others who
depend on them, which itself raises issues of equity. A multi

dimensional / multi

framework assessment
helps to explai
n why such investments have continued, even in rich countries, and the consequent risks,
and
the complexity of shifting such investments in all countries.
It may also inform approaches that
could exploit path

dependence in clean energy systems, if there is
sufficient investment in building up
the low

Carbon pricing.

S
tern’s
(2007)
reference to climate change as “the greatest market failure in history” highlights that
damages inflicted by climate change are not properly costed in
most
economic decision
-
making.
Economic perspectives emphasise the value of removing fossil
-
fuel subsidi
es, and pricing emissions to
‘internalise’ in economic decision
-
making the ‘external’ damages imposed by GHG emissions
, and/or
to meet agreed goals
.
Aggregate economic frameworks generally indicate carbon pricing
(on principles
which extend to other gases
) as the most cost
-
effective way to reduce emissions,
notwithstanding
various
market failures which complicate this logic
.

T
he High Level Commission on carbon pricing
(Stern and Stiglitz 2017)
estimated an appropriate range as USD40

in 2020, rising steadily
thereafter.
In practice the extent and level of carbon pricing implemented to date is far lower than this
or than most economic analys
e
s now recommend
(
Section 3.6.1 in
Chapter 3)
, and nowhere is carbon
pricing the only instrument deployed.
A socio
-
cultural and equity perspective emphasises that the faith in and role of markets varies widely
between countries
–
many energy systems do no in fact operate on a basis of competitive ma
rkets
–
and
that because market
-
based carbon pricing involves large revenues transfers, it
must also contend with
major
distributional effects and political viability
(Klenert et al. 2018; Pri
nn et al. 2017)
, both
domestic
(Ch
apter
13)
and international
(Ch
apter

)
.
A major review
(Maestre
-
Andrés et al. 2019)
finds
persistent distributional concerns
(
rich
incumbents
have also been
vocal in using arguments about
impacts on the poor
(Rennkamp 2019)
,
but suggests these
may be addressed by combining
redistribution of revenues with suppor
t for low carbon innovation
.
Measures could include
redistributing the tax revenue to favour of low
-
income groups
or differentiated carbon taxes
(Metcalf
2009; Klenert and Mattauch 2016; Stiglitz 2019)
, including
‘
dual track
’
a
pproaches
(van den Bergh et
al. 2020)
.
To an extent though, all these
depend on levels of trust, and institutional capacity.
Technological and transitions perspectives in turn find carbon pricing incentives may only stimulate
incremental improvements, but other instruments may be much more effective for driving deeper
innov
ation and transitions (
C
hapters 14, 15, 16)
, whilst psychological and behavioural studies
emphasise many factors beyond only pricing (
Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 in
Chapter 5).
In practice, a wide
range of policy instruments are used
(Chapter 13).
Finally,
i
n economic theory, negotiations on a common carbon price (or other common policies) may
have
large
benefits (less subject to ‘free riding’)
compared to
a focus on negotiating national targets
(Cramton et al. 2017a)
.
The fact that this has never even been seriously considered (outside some efforts
in the EU)
may
reflect the
exceptional
sovereignty
sensitivities around taxation and cultural differences
around the role of markets
.
H
owever, c
arbon pricing concepts can be important outside of the traditional
