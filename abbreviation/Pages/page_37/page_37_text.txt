. In this context, coal assets are projected to be at risk of being stranded before 2030, while
oil and gas assets are projected to be more at risk of being stranded toward mid-century. A low-emission
energy sector transition is projected to reduce international trade in fossil fuels. (

Global methane emissions from energy supply, primarily fugitive emissions from production
and transport of fossil fuels, accounted for about 18% [13%-23%] of global GHG emissions from
energy supply, 32% [22%-42%] of global methane emissions, and 6% [4%-8%] of global GHG
emissions in 2019 (

C.4.6
CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources,
provided geological storage is available. When CO
2
is captured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS),
or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO
2
capture
and subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In
contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and
chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological CO
2
storage
capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 gigatonnes of CO
2
, which is more than the CO
2
storage
requirements through 2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional availability of
geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and
managed, it is estimated that the CO
2
can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation
of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-
cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways
limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public
support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers. (
