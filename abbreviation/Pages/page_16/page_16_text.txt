B.6.1
Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions
than those implied by NDCs, indicating an implementation gap. A gap remains between global GHG
emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 and those
associated with modelled mitigation pathways assuming immediate action (for quantification see Table
SPM.X).
[FOOTNOTE 27] The magnitude of the emission gap depends on the global warming level
considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs
[FOOTNOTE 28] are
considered.[FOOTNOTE 29] (
