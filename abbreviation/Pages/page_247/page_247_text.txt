different regions are shown by bubbles, with sizes representing total GHG emissions. Figure 1.

also
shows the estimated position of the SDGs zone for the ye
ar 2030, and a “sustainable development
corridor”
as countries reach towards higher HDI and lower emissions.
To fulfil the SDGs, including
SDG 13 climate action, the historic relationship needs to change.
The top of the SDG zone is situated around the global per capita GHG emissions level of
5

eq required for the world to be path towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement
.

The horizontal position
of the SDG zone is estimated based on the HIHD levels
(Prados de la Escosura 2015)
of countries that
have been shown to either have achieved, or have some challenges, when it comes to SDG 3, SDG 4
and SDG 8
(Sachs et al. 2016)
;
as these SDGs are related to the constituent parts of the HIHD. Beyond
2030,
the sustainable development corridor allows for increasing levels of human development while
lowering per capita GHG emissions.
Figure 1.

shows that at present, regions with HIHD levels of around 0.5 all have emissions at or above
about 5tCO

, but there
are wide variations within this. Indeed, there are regions with HIHD levels above 0.8 which have GHG
per
-
capita emissions lower than several with HIHD levels of around 0.5.
The mitigation challenge
involves countries at many different stages of development seeking paths towards higher welfare with
low emissions.
From Figure 1.

, there are two distinct
dimensions to
sustainable development pathways for fulfilling
the SDGs
. In
terms of per
-
capita GHG emissions (the vertical),
s
ome regions have such low levels that
they could increase and
still
be below the global
average
required in 2030 for the world to be on path
to fulfil the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile other regions
with
hig
h per capita GHG emissions
would
require a
rapid
transformation in technologies and practices
.
It is against this background that
Dubash
(2019)
emphasises placing the need for urgent action on climate change in the context of domestic
political priorities and the institutions within which national frameworks are crystallised.
Concerns over equity in the context of growing global inequality and very tight remaining global carbon
budgets have
motivated an
emphasis on equitable access to sustainable development
(Peters et al. 2015;
Kartha et al. 2018b; Matthews et al. 2019; van den Berg et a
l. 2019)
.
This literature emphasises the
need for less developed countries to have sufficient
room for development while addressing climate
change
(Pan et al. 2014; Winkler et al. 2013; Gajevic Sayegh 2017; Warlenius 2018; Robinson and
Shine 2018)
. Meanwhile, many countries reliant o
n
fossil fuels, related technologies and economic
activities are eager to ensure tax revenues are
maintained, workers and industries have income and
justice is embedded in the economic transformations required to limit GHG emissions
(Cronin et al.
2021)
