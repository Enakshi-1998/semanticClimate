temporarily exceeding 1.5°C global warming by 0.1-0.3°C for up to several decades.
•
Category C3 comprises modelled scenarios that limit peak warming to 2°C throughout the 21st
century with a likelihood of greater than 67%. In this report, these scenarios are also referred
to as scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%)
.
•
Categories C4-C7 comprise modelled scenarios that limit warming to 2°C, 2.5°C, 3°C, 4°C,
respectively, throughout the 21st century with a likelihood of greater than 50%. In some
scenarios in C4 and many scenarios in C5-C7, warming continues beyond the 21
st
century.
•
Category C8 comprises modelled scenarios that exceed warming of 4°C during the 21
st
century
with a likelihood of 50% or greater. In these scenarios warming continues to rise beyond the
21
st
century.
Categories of modelled scenarios are distinct and do not overlap; they do not contain categories
consistent with lower levels of global warming, e.g., the category of C3 scenarios that limit warming to
2°C (>67%) does not include the C1 and C2 scenarios that limit or return warming to 1.5°C (>50%).
Where relevant, scenarios belonging to the group of categories C1-C3 are referred to in this report as
scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower.
FOOTNOTE 47:
The future scenario projections presented here are consistent with the total observed
increase in global surface temperature between 1850-1900 and 1995-2014 as well as to 2011-2020 (with
best estimates of 0.85 and 1.09°C, respectively) assessed in WGI. The largest contributor to historical
human-induced warming is CO
2
, with historical cumulative CO
2
emissions from 1850 to 2019 being
2400 ± 240 (GtCO
2
). {WGI SPM A.1.2,WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Table 5.1, Section B}
FOOTNOTE 48:
In case no explicit likelihood is provided, the reported warming levels are associated
with a likelihood of >50%.
FOOTNOTE 49
: Scenarios in this category are found to have simultaneous likelihood to limit peak
global warming to 2°C throughout the 21
st
century of close to and more than 90%.
