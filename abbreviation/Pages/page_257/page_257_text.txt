The
re is
usually
a social dimension to such transitions. Key elements include capacity to transform
(Folke et al. 2010)
, planning, and interdisciplinarity
(Woiwode 2013)
. The Second World War
demonstrated the extent to which crises can motivate (sometimes positive) change across complex
social and technical systems,
including industry, and agriculture
which then doub
led its productivity
over 15 years
(Roberts and Geels 2019b)
.
In practice, climate change may involve a combination of
(reactive)
transformational adaptation
, and (proactive)
societal transformation
(Feola 2015)
, the latter
seen as
reorient
ation
(in
cluding values and norms
)
in a sustainable direction (
Section 5.4 in
C
hapter 5)
,
including eg. ‘
democratisation
’
in energy systems
(Sorman et al. 2020)
.
Business change management
principles could be relevant to support positive social change
(Stephan et al. 2016)
.
Overall, effective
transitions rest on appropriate enabling conditions, which can also link socio
-
technical transitions to
broader development
pathways (Cross

in Chapter 16
).
Transition theories tend to come from very different disciplines
and approaches compared to either
economics or other social sciences, with less quantification
,
notwithstanding evolutionary and complex
system models (1.7.
1.
3)
. However, a few distinct types of
quantitative
models of ‘socio
-
technical
energy transition’
(Li et al. 2015)
have emerged.
For policy evaluation, transitions can be viewed as
processes in which dynamic efficiency (1.

wit
h
potential
‘positive intervention points’
(Farmer et al. 2019)
.
Given inherent uncertaintie
s, there are obvious risks
(e.g.
Alic and Sarewitz 2016)
.
All t
his may make an evaluation framework of
risks and opportunities
more appropriate than traditional cost
-
benefit
(Mercure et al. 2021)
, and (drawing on lessons from
renewables and electric vehicles), create foundations for sector
-
based international ‘positive sum
cooperation’ in climate mitigation
(Sharpe and Lenton 2021)
.

Approaches from
p
sychology and politics of changing course
The continued increase in global emissions to 2019, d
espite three
decades of scientific warnings of ever
-
greater clarity and urgency, motivates
growing
attention
in the literature
to the psychological ‘faults of
our rationality’
(Bryck and Ellis 2016)
, and the political nature of climate mitigation
.
1.7.4.1
Psychological and behavi
oural dimensions
AR5 emphasised that decision processes often include both deliberate (‘calculate the costs and
beneﬁts’) and intuitive thinking, the latter utilising emotion
-
and rule
-
based responses that are
conditioned by personal past experience, social context, and cu
ltural factors
(e.g. Kahneman 2003)
, and
that laypersons tend to judge risks differently than experts
-
for example, ‘intuitive’ reacti
ons are often
characterised by biases to status quo and aversion to perceived risks and ambiguity
(Kahneman and
Tversky 1979)
. Many of these features of human reasoning create ‘psychological distance’ from climate
change
(Spence et al. 2012; Marshall 2014)
. These can impede adequate personal responses, in addition
to the collective nature of the problem, where such problems can take the form of ‘
uncomfortable
knowledg
e’, neglected and so becoming
‘Unknown knowns’
(Sarewitz 2020)
.
These decision processes,
and the perceptions that shape them, have been
studied through different lenses from psychology
(Weber 2016)
to sociology
(Guilbeaul
t et al. 2018)
,
and
media studies
(Boykoff 2011)
.
Karlsson and
Gilek
(2020)
identify
science denialism and ‘decision thresholds’ as key mechanisms of delay.

measures or other mitigati

, including

, as “
we often resist actions with clear long

term
benefits if they are unpleasant in the short run.”
(Allcott and Mullainatha
n 2010)
.
Incorporating
behavioural and social dynamics in models
is required particularly to better represent the demand side
(Nikas et al. 2020)
,
eg.
Safarzyńska
(2018)
demonstrates
how behavioural factors chang
e responses to
carbon pricing relative to other instruments.
A key perspective is to eschew ‘either/or’ between
