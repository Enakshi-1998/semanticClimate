access to, and the affordability of, energy, food, and water can be avoided by well-implemented land-
based mitigation options, especially those that do not threaten existing sustainable land uses and land
rights, though more frameworks for integrated policy implementation are required. The sustainability
of bioenergy and other biobased products is influenced by feedstock, land management practice,
climatic region, the context of existing land management, and the timing, scale and speed of
deployment. (

CDR methods such as soil carbon sequestration and biochar [FOOTNOTE 71] can improve
soil quality and food production capacity. Ecosystem restoration and reforestation sequester carbon in
plants and soil, and can enhance biodiversity and provide additional biomass, but can displace food
production and livelihoods, which calls for integrated approaches to land use planning, to meet multiple
objectives including food security. However, due to limited application of some of the options today,
there are some uncertainties about potential benefits (

: Potential risks, knowledge gaps due to the relative immaturity of use of biochar as
soil amendment and unknown impacts of widespread application, and co-benefits of biochar are
reviewed in 7.4.3.2.
