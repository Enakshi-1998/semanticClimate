3.7°C to 4.8°
C compared to pre

industrial levels. AR5 noted that mitigation effort and the costs
associated with ambitious mitigation differ significantly across countries, and in ‘globally cost
-
effective’ scenarios, the biggest reductions (relative to projections) occ
ur in the countries with the
highest future emissions in the baseline scenarios
(IPCC 2014b, p. 17)
.
Since most phy
sical capital (e.g.
power plants, buildings, transport infrastructure) involved in GHG emissions is long
-
lived, the timing
of the shift in investments and strategies will be crucial
(IPCC 2014b, p. 18)
.
A key message from recent Special Reports is the urgency to mitigate GHG emissions in order to avoid
rapid and potentially irreversible changes in natural and human sy
stems
(IPCC 2019b, 2018b, 2019a)
.
Successive IPCC reports have drawn upon increasing sophistication of modelling tools to project
emissions
in the absence of ambitious decarbonisation action, as well as the emission pathways that
meet long term temperature targets. The SR1.5
examined
pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C
,
compared to historical baseline of 1850
-
1900, finding that “in pathways wi
th
no or limited overshoot
of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO

decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030,
reaching net zero

rapid and far

reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and
buildings), and industrial systems (

)
(IPCC 2018b)
.
SR1.5 found that t
he
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as declared under the Paris
Agreement (PA)
would not limit warming to 1.5 C
; despite significant updates to NDCs in 2020/21,
this remains the case though delivery of th
ese more ambition NDCs would
somewhat
enhance the
prospects for staying
below 2°C
(
S
ection 1.3.3).
AR5
WGIII
and the Special Reports analysed economic costs associated with climate action. The
estimates vary widely depending on the assumptions made as to
how ordered the transition is,
temperature target, technology
availability
, the metric or model used, among others (
C
hapter 6).
Modelled direct mitigation costs of pathways to 1.5°C, with no/limited overshoot, span a wide range,
but were typically 3
-
4 times higher than in pathways to 2°C (
high confidence
), before taking account
of benefits, including significant reduction in loss
of life and livelihoods, and avoided climate impacts
(IPCC 2018b)
.
Successive IPCC Reports highlight a strong connection between climate mitigation and sustainable
development. Climate mitigation and adaptation goals have synergie
s and trade
-
offs with efforts to
achieve sustainable development, including poverty eradication.
A comprehensive assessment of
climate policy therefore involves going beyond a narrow focus on specific mitigation and adaptation
options to incorporate climat
e issues into the design of comprehensive strategies for equitable
sustainable development. At the same time, some climate mitigation policies can run counter to
sustainable development and eradicating poverty
, which highlights the need to consider trade
-
o
ffs
alongside benefits
. Examples include synergies between climate policy and improved air quality,
reducing premature deaths and morbidity
(IPCC 2014b Fig SPM.6; AR6 WG1 sections 6.6.3 and 6.7.3)
,
but there would be tra
de
-
offs if policy raises net energy bills, with distributional implications.
T
he
Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) also emphasises important synergies and trade
-
offs, bringing new light on the link between healthy and sustainable food consu
mption and emissions
caused by the agricultural sector. Land
-
related responses that contribute to climate change adaptation
and mitigation can also combat desertification and land degradation and enhance food security
(IPCC
2019a)
.
Previous ARs have detailed the contribution of various sectors and activiti
es to global GHG emissions.
When indirect emissions (mainly from electricity, heat and other energy conversions) are included, the
four main consumption (end
-
use) drivers are industry, AFOLU, buildings and transport
