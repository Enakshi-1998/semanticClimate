to agriculture and forestry. A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would
greatly advance mitigation. Effective po
licy interventions and national (investment) plans as part of
NDCs, specific to local circumstances and needs, are urgently needed to accelerate the deployment of
AFOLU mitigation options. These interventions are effective when they include funding schemes
and
long
-
term consistent support for implementation with governments taking the initiative together with
private funders and non
-
state actors. {7.6}
Reali
s
ing the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector depends strongly on policies that directly
address
emissions and drive the deployment of land
-
based mitigation options, consistent with
carbon prices in deep mitigation
scenarios (
high confidence
).
Examples of
successful policies and
measures include establishing and respecting tenure rights and community
forestry, improved
agricultural management and sustainable intensification, biodiversity conservation, payments for
ecosystem services, improved forest management and wood chain usage, bioenergy, voluntary supply
chain management efforts, consumer behaviou
r campaigns, private funding and joint regulatory efforts
to avoid e.g., leakage. The efficacy of different policies, however, will depend on numerous region
-
specific factors. In addition to funding, these factors include governance, institutions, long
-
ter
m
consistent execution of measures, and the specific policy setting.
While the
governance of land
-
based
mitigatio
n
can draw on lessons from previous experience with regulating biofuels and forest carbon
integrating these insights requires governance that g

level approaches
emphasising
integrated land use planning and management within the frame of the sustainable development goals.

Addressing the many knowledge gaps in the development and testing of AFOLU
mitigation
options can rapidly advance the likelihood of achieving sustained mitigation (
high
confidence
).
Research priorities include improved quantification of anthropogenic and natural GHG fluxes and
emissions modelling, better understanding of the impa
cts of climate change on the mitigation potential,
permanence and additionality of estimated mitigation actions, and improved (real time
and
cheap)
measurement, reporting and verification. There is a need to include a greater suite of mitigation
measures i
n IAMs, informed by more realistic assessments that take into account local circumstances
and socio
-
economic factors and cross
-
sector synergies and trade
-
offs. Finally, there is a critical need
for more targeted research to develop appropriate country
-
leve
l, locally specific, policy and land
management response options. These options could support more specific NDCs with AFOLU
measures that enable mitigation while also contributing to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem
functioning, livelihoods for million
s of farmers and foresters, and many other SDGs. {7.7

Food
systems
Realising the full mitigation potential from the food system requires change at all stages from
producer to consumer and waste
management, which can be facilitated through i

(high confidence)
.

42% of global GHG emissions are associated with food systems, while
there is still wide

. Both supply and dema
nd side measures
are important to reduce the GHG intensity of food systems.
Integrated food policy packages based on a
combination of market
-
based, administrative, informative, and behavioural policies
can
reduce cost
compared to uncoordinated intervention
s, address multiple sustainability goals, and increase acceptance
across stakeholders and civil society
(limited evidence, medium agreement).
Food systems governance
may be pioneered through local food policy initiatives complemented by national and intern
ational
initiatives, but governance on the national level tends to be fragmented, and thus have limited capacity
to address structural issues like inequities in access.
