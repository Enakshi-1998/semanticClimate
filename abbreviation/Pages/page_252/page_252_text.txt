analysis concludes that early deployment of expensive PV was of
net global economic benefit, due to
induced innovation
(Newbery 2018)
.
Research thus increasingly emphasises the need to understand climate transformation in terms of
dynamic, rather than static,
efficiency
(Gillingham and Stock 2018)
. This means taking account of
inertia, learning and various additional sources of ‘path
-
dependence’. Including induced innovation in
stylised IAMs can radically change the o
utlook
(Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2016)
, albeit with limitations
(Pottier et al. 2014)
; many more
detailed
-
process IAMs now do include endogenous technical change
(as reviewed in
Yang et al.
(2018)
and
Grubb et al.
(2021b)
; also Annex
III
)
.
These dynamic and uncertainty effects typically justify greater up
-
front effort
(Kalkuhl et al. 2012;
Bertram et al. 2015)
, including accelerated international diffusion
(Schultes et al. 2018)
, and strengthen
optimal init
ial effort in cost

benefit
models
(Grubb et a
l. 2021b; Baldwin et al. 2020)
. Approaches to
risk premia common in finance would similarly
amplify the initial mitigation effort, declining as
uncertainties reduce
(Daniel et al. 2019)
.
1.7.1.3
Disequilibrium, complex systems and evolutionary approaches
Other approaches to aggregate evaluation draw on various branches of intrinsically non
-
equilibrium
theor
ies
(e.g. Chang 2014)
. These including long
-
standing theories from the 1930s
(e.g.
Schumpeter
1934a; Keynes 1936)
to understand situations of structurally under
-
employed resources, potential
financial instabilities
(Minsky 1986)
, and
related economic approaches which emphasise
time
dimensions
(e.g. recent reviews in Legrand and Hagemann
2017; Stern 2018)
. More recently
developing have been formal economic theories of
endogenous
growth building on eg.
Romer
(1986)
,
and developments of Schumpeterian creative destruction
(Aghion et al. 2021)
and evolutionary
economic theories which abandon any notion of full or stable resource utilisation even as a reference
concept
(Nelson and Winter 1982; Freeman and Perez 1988;
Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991
; Perez
2001
;
Freeman and Louçã 2001)
.
The latter especially are technica
l
l
y
grounded in complex system theories
(e.g. Arthur 1989, 1999;
Beinhocker 2007; Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009)
. These take inherently dynamic views of economies
as continually evolving systems with c
ontinuously unfolding and path
-
dependent properties
,
and
emphasise uncertainty in contrast to
any
predictab
le or default
optimality
. Such approaches have been
variously applied in policy evaluation
(Walton 2014
;
Moore et al. 2018)
, and specifically for global
decarbonisation
(e.g. Barker and Crawford
-
Brown 2014)
using
global
s
imulation models. Because these
have no natural reference
‘least lost’ trajectory
, they illustrate
varied and divergent
pathways and tend
to emphasise the diversity of possibilities and relevant policies, particularly linked to innovation and
potentially ‘
sensitive intervention points’
(Farmer et al. 2019; see also section 1.7.3)
. They also illustrate
that different representations of innovation and financial markets together can explain why estimated
impacts of mitigation on GDP can differ
very widely (potentially even in sign), between different model
types (Chapter 15,
Section 15.6.3 and Box 15.7).
1.7.2
Ethical approaches
Gardiner's (2011)
description of climate chang
e as
”The Perfect Moral Storm” identified three
‘tempests’. Its
global
dimension, in a world of sovereign states which have only fragmentary
responsibility and control, makes it ‘difficult to generate the moral consideration and necessary political
will’.
Its impacts are
intergenerational
but future generations have no voice in contemporary affairs,
the usual mechanism for addressing distributional injustices
, amplified by
the intrinsic inequity of
wealthy big emitters impacting particularly poorer victims
.
He argues that these
are exacerbated by
a
third,
theoretical
failure to acknowledge a central need for ‘
moral sensitivity, compassion, transnational
and transgenerational care, and other forms of ethical concern to rise to the surface
’ to help guide
