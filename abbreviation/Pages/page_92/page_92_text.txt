and overall GHG emissions in 2030 compared to
immediate action scenarios. This is followed by a much faster reduction of emissions
and fossil fuels
after 2030, and a larger increase in the deployment of low carbon alternatives during the medium term
in order to get close to the levels of the immediate action pathways in 2050. Those pathways
also
deploy
a larger amount of

to compensate for higher emissions before 2030.
