decent jobs; social protection; employment rights; fairness in energy access and use and social dialogue
and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders.
The concept has evolved, becoming prominent in the United States in 1980, r
elated to environmental
regulations that resulted in job losses from highly polluting industries. Traced from a purely labour
movement, trade union space,
the
Just Transition
f
ramework
emphasises that
decent
work and
environmental protection are not incomp
atible. During COP 24, with the Just Transition Silesia
Declaration, the concept gained in recognition and was signed by 56 Heads of State.
Implicit in
a
Just Transition
is the notion of well
-
being, equity and justice
–
the realisation that
transition
s
are
inherently disruptive
and
deliberate effort
may be required
to ensure
communities
dependent on fossil
-
fuel based economies and industries do not suffer disproportionately {Chapter 4}.
‘Just transitions’ are integral to the European Union as mentioned in t
he EU Green Deal, the Scottish
Government’s development plans and other national low carbon transition strategies. The US Green
New Deal Resolution puts structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and ‘Just
Transitions’
at its centre.
There is a growing awa
reness of the need for shifting finance towards Just Transition in the context of
the COVID
-
19, in particular, public finance and governance have a major role in allowing Just
Transition broadly {Chapter 15}.
In the immediate aftermath of the COVID
-
19 pand
emic, low oil prices created additional financial
problems for fossil fuel producer
countries faced with loss of revenue and reduced fiscal latitude and
space. Public spending and social safety nets associated with the proceeds from producer economies
can
be affected as assets become stranded and spending on strategic sustainable development goals such
as free education and health care services are neglected. Fiscal challenges are intricately linked to ‘Just
Transitions’ and the management associated w
ith sustainable energy transition. There is no certainty on
how energy systems will recover post
-
COVID
-
19. However, ‘Just Transitions’ will have equity
implications if stimulus
packages are
implemented without due regard for the differentiated scales and
s
peeds and national and regional contexts, especially in the context of developing countries.
A
Just
T
ransition
entails
targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and other non
-
state authorities to ensure that any negative social, environme
ntal, or economic impacts of economy
-
wide transitions are minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected.
These proactive measures include eradication of poverty, regulating prosperity and creating jobs in
“green” sectors. In
addition, governments, polluting industries, corporations, and those more able to
pay higher associated taxes
,
can pay for transition costs by providing a welfare safety net and adequate
compensation
to
people, communities, and regions that have been impa
cted by pollution, or are
marginalised
,
or
are
negatively impacted by a transition from a high
-
to low
-
carbon economy and
society.
T
here is
, no
netheless
,
increased recognition that resources that can enable the transition,
international development instit
utions
,
as well as other transitional drivers such as tools, strategies and
finance
,
are scarce. A sample of global efforts
are
summarised in Box TS.
