While extreme poverty has fallen in more than hal
f of the world’s economies in recent years, nearly one

fifth of countries faced poverty rates above 30% in 2015 (below USD1.90 a day), reflecting
large

(Frame et al.

.
An important recent development has been commitments
by many countries, now covering a large majority
of global emissions,
to reach net zero CO
2
or greenhouse gas emissions (Chapter 3)
.

Furthermore, globally,
net
zero targets (whether CO
2
or GHG) have been adopted by about 823 cities and 101 regions (Chapter 8).

Some Other Key Trends and Developments
T
he
COVID
-
19 pandemic
profoundly impacted economy and human society, globally and within
countries.
As detailed
in
Cross
-
Chapter Box 1, s
om
e of its impacts will be long lasting, permanent even,
and there are also lessons relevant to climate change
. The direct impact on emissions projected
for rest of
this decade are modest, but
t
he necessity for economic recovery pack
ages creates a central role for
government
-
led investment, and may change the economic fundamentals involved for some years to come.
T
he COVID
-
19 aftermath consequently also changes the economic context for mitigation
(
Sections 15.2
and
15.4
in Chapter 15
)
.
Many
traditional forms of economic analysis (expressed as general equilibrium)
assume that available economic resources are fully employed, with limited scope for beneficial economic
‘multiplier effects’ of government
-
led investment.
After COVID
-
19 however, no country is in this state.
Very low interest rates amplify opportunities for large
-
scale investments which
could bring ‘economic
multiplier’ benefits,
especially if they help to build the industries and infrastructures for further
clean
growth
(Hepburn et al. 2020)
. However, the capability to mobilise l
ow interest finance vary markedly across
countries and large public debts
-
including bringing some developing countries close to default
-
undermine
both the political appetite and feasibility of large
-
scale clean in
vestments. In practice the current ori
entation
of COVID
-
19 recovery packages is very varied, pointing to a very mixed picture about whether or not
countries are exploiting this opportunity (Cross
-
Chapter Box 1
).
