materials {Box 12.2} and even a “circular carbon economy”

wherein ca
rbon captured via CCU
{11.3.6} or CDR {3.4.6} is converted into reusable materials, which is especially relevant for
the
transitions of economies dependent on fossil fuel revenue

While there are many recycling policies, CE
-
oriented policies for mor
e efficient material use with
higher value retention are comparatively far fewer; these policy gaps have been attributed to
institutional failures, lack of coordination, and lack of strong advocates {5.3

Box
12.2}.
R
eviews of mitigation
potentials reveal unevenness in the savings of CE applications and
potential risks of rebound effects {5.3}. Therefore, CE policies that identify system determinants
maximize potential emissions reductions, which
vary by material, location, and applicati
on.
There are knowledge gaps for assessing CE opportunities within mitigation models due to CE’s many
cross
-
sectoral linkages and data gaps related to its nascent state {3.4.4}. Opportunity exists to bridge
knowledge from the Industrial Ecology field, whi
ch has historically studied CE, to the mitigation
modelling community for improved analysis of interventions and policies for AR7. For instance, a
global CE knowledge sharing platform is helpful for CE performance measurement, reporting and
accounting

Providing better services with less energy and resource input has high technical potential and is
consistent with providing well

for all (
medium confidence)
.
The a
ssessment of 19 demand
-
side mitigation options and 18 different constituents of well
-
being
show
ed
that positive impacts on well

being outweigh negative ones by a factor of 11. {

side mitigation options bring multiple interacti

benefits (
high confidence
).
Energy
services to meet human needs for nutrition, shelter, health, etc. are met in many different ways with
different emissions implications that depend on local contexts, cultures, geography, available
technologies,
and
soc
ial preferences. In the near term, many less
-
developed countries
,
and poor people
everywhere
,
require better access to safe and low
-
emissions energy sources to ensure decent living
standards and increase energy savings from service improvements by about 20

25%.

Granular technologies and decentralized energy end

use, characterised by modularity, small unit
sizes and small unit costs, diffuse faster into markets and
are associated with faster technological
learning benefits,
greater efficiency, more opportunities to escape technological lock

in, and
greater employment (
high confidence).
Examples include solar
PV
systems, batteries, and thermal
heat pumps.

Wealthy individuals contribute disproportionately to higher emissions and have a high potential
for emissions reductions while maintaining decent living standards and well

being
(high
confidence).
Individuals with high socio
-
economic sta
tus are capable of reducing their GHG emissions
by becoming role models of low
-
carbon lifestyles, investing in low
-
carbon businesses, and advocating
for stringent climate policies. {5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, Figure 5.14}
Demand

side solutions require both motiv
ation and capacity
for change (
high confidence
).
Motivation by individuals or households worldwide to change energy consumption behaviour is
generally low. Individual behavioural change is insufficient for climate change mitigation unless
embedded in struc
tural and cultural change. Different factors influence individual motivation and
capacity for change in different demographics and geographies. These factors go beyond traditional
socio
-
demographic and economic predictors and include psychological variable
s such as awareness,
perceived risk, subjective and social norms, values, and perceived behavioural control. Behavioural
