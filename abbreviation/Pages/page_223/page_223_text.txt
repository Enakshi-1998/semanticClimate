Lessons.
Important lessons ca
n be drawn from the pandemic to climate change including the value of
forward
-
looking risk management, the role of scientific assessment, preparatory action and international
process and institutions
(
1.3,
Chapter
5
)
. There had been long
-
standing warnings
of pandemic risks, and
precursors
–
with both pandemic and climate risks being identified by social scientists as ‘uncomfortable
knowledge’, or ‘unknown knowns’ which tend to be marginalised in practical policy
(Rayner 2012;
Sarewitz 2020)
. This echoes long
-
standing climate literature on potential ‘high impact’ events
,
including
those
perceived
as low probability
(Dietz 2011; Weitzman 2011)
.
The costs of preparatory action, mainly
in those countries that had suffered from earlier pandemics were negligible in comparison, suggesting the
importance not just of knowledge but its effective communica
tion and embodiment in society (Chapter 5)
.
(Klenert et al. 2020)
offer five early lessons for climate policy, concerning: the cost of delay; the bias in
human judgement; the inequality of impacts; the need for multiple forms of international cooperation; and
finally, ‘t
ransparency in value judgements at the science
-
policy interface’.

The IMF projects sovereign debt to
