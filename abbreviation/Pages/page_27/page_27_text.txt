Box SPM.1: Assessment of modelled global emission scenarios
A wide range of modelled global emission pathways and scenarios from the literature is assessed in this
report, including pathways and scenarios with and without mitigation.[FOOTNOTE 45] Emissions
pathways and scenarios project the evolution of GHG emissions based on a set of internally consistent
assumptions about future socio-economic conditions and related mitigation measures.[FOOTNOTE 46]
These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Around half of all modelled
global emission scenarios assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost emission abatement
options globally. The other half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated
actions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about global equity, environmental justice or intra-
regional income distribution. Global emission pathways, including those based on cost effective
approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with
the careful recognition of these assumptions. This assessment focuses on their global characteristics.
The majority of the assessed scenarios (about 80%) have become available since the SR1.5, but some
were assessed in that report. Scenarios with and without mitigation were categorised based on their
projected global warming over the 21
st
century, following the same scheme as in the SR1.5 for warming
up to and including 2°C. {1.5, 3.2, 3.3, Annex III.II.2, Annex III.II.3}
FOOTNOTE
45: In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the
former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. For this reason, this SPM uses mostly the term
(emissions and mitigation) pathways. {Annex III.II.1.1}
FOOTNOTE
46: Key assumptions relate to technology development in agriculture and energy systems
and socio-economic development, including demographic and economic projections. IPCC is neutral
with regard to the assumptions underlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which
do not cover all possible futures. Additional scenarios may be developed. The underlying population
assumptions range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 7.4 to 10.9 billion in 2100 (5-95th percentile)
starting from 7.6 billion in 2019. The underlying assumptions on global GDP growth (ppp) range from
2.5 to 3.5% per year in the 2019-2050 period and 1.3 to 2.1% per year in the 2050-2100 (5-95th
percentile). Many underlying assumptions are regionally differentiated. {1.5; 3.2; 3.3; Figure 3.9;
Annex III.II.1.4; Annex III.II.3}
Scenario categories are defined by their likelihood of exceeding global warming levels (at peak and in
2100) and referred to in this report as follows [FOOTNOTE 47, 48]:
•
Category C1 comprises modelled scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C in 2100 with a
likelihood of greater than 50%, and reach or exceed warming of 1.5°C during the 21st century
with a likelihood of 67% or less. In this report, these scenarios are referred to as scenarios that
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. Limited overshoot refers to
exceeding 1.5°C global warming by up to about 0.1°C and for up to several decades.
[FOOTNOTE 49]
•
Category C2 comprises modelled scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C in 2100 with a
likelihood of greater than 50%, and exceed warming of 1.5°C during the 21st century with a
likelihood of greater than 67%. In this report, these scenarios are also referred to as scenarios
