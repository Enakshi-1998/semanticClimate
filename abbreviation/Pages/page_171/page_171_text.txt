Overview of emission mitigation options and their
cost and potential for the year 2030.

legend:
The mitigation potential of each
option is
the quantity of net greenhouse gas emission
reductions that can be achieved by a given
mitigation option relative to
specified emission baselines
that reflects
what would be considered current policies in the period 2015
-
2019. Mitigation options may overla
p or interact
and cannot simply be summed together.
The potential for each option is broken down into cost categories (see legend). Only monetary costs and
revenues are considered. If costs are less than zero, lifetime monetary revenues are higher than li
fetime
monetary costs. For wind energy, for example, negative cost indicates that the cost is lower than that of fossil
-
based electricity production.
The error bars refer to the total potential for each option. The breakdown into cost
categories is subject
to uncertainty. Where a smooth colour transition is shown, the breakdown of the potential
into cost categories is not well researched, and the colours indicate only into which cost category the potential
can predominantly be found in the literature.

Carbon leakage is a cross
-
sectoral and cross
-
country consequence of differentiated climate policy
(robust evidence, medium agreement)
.
Carbon leakage occurs when mitigation measures implemented
in one country/sector leads to increased emissions in other countries/sectors. Global commodity value
chains and associated international transport are importan
t mechanisms through which carbon leakage
occurs. Reducing emissions from the value chain and transportation can offer opportunities to mitigate
three elements of cross
-
sectoral spill
-
overs and related leakage: 1) domestic cross
-
sectoral spill
-
overs
within
the same country; 2) international spill
-
overs within a single sector resulting from substitution
of domestic production of carbon
-
intensive goods with their imports from abroad; and 3) international
cross
-
sectoral spill
-
overs among sectors in different c
ountries
