Digitalisation
Digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency through coordination and an
economic shift to services, but they can also greatly increase energy demand because of the energy used
in digital devices

Digital devices, including servers, increase pressure on the environment due to the demand for rare
metals and end
-
of
-
life disposal. The absence of adequate governance in many countries can lead to
ha
rsh working conditions and unregulated disposal of electronic waste. Digitali
s
ation also affects firms'
competitiveness, the demand for skills, and the distribution of, and access to resources. The existing
digital divide, especially in developing countrie
s, and the lack of appropriate governance of the digital
revolution can hamper the role that digitali
s
ation could play in supporting the achievement of stringent
mitigation targets. At present, the understanding of both the direct and indirect impacts of d
igitali
s
ation
on energy use, carbon emissions and potential mitigation is limited (
medium confidence
).
The digital transformation is a megatrend that is fundamentally changing all economies and societies,
albeit in very different ways depending on the level of development of a given country and on the nature
of its economic system. Digital technologies have
significant potential to contribute to decarbonisation
due to their ability to increase energy and material efficiency, make transport and building systems less
wasteful, and improve the access to services for consumers and citizens. Yet, if left unmanage
d, the
digital transformation
will probably
increase energy demand, exacerbate inequities and the
concentration of power
,
leaving developing economies with less access to digital technologies behind,
raise ethical issues, reduce labour demand and compromis
e citizensâ€™ welfare. Appropriate governance
of the digital transformation can ensure that digitalisation works as an enabler, rather than as a barrier
and further strain in decarboni
s
ation pathways. Governance can ensure that digitalisation not only
reduce
s GHG emissions intensity but also contributes to reducing absolute GHG emission, constraining
run

away consumption. {Cross

Digital technologies have the potential to reduce energy demand in all end
-
use sectors through
steep
improvements in energy efficiency. This includes material input savings and increased coordination as
they allow
the
use
of fewer
inputs to perform a given task. Smart appliances and energy management,
supported by choice architectures, economic ince
ntives and social norms, effectively reduce energy
demand and associated GHG emissions by 5
-
10% while maintaining
equal
service levels. Data centres
can also play a role in energy system management, for example by waste heat utilisation where district
heat
systems are
close by
; temporal and spatial scheduling of electricity demand can provide about 6%
of the total potential demand response. {5.5, Cross

}
Digital technologies, analytics and connectivity consume large amoun
ts of energy implying higher
direct energy demand and related carbon emissions. Global energy demand from digital appliances
reached 7.14 EJ in 2018. The demand for computing services increased by 550% between 2010 and
2018 and is now estimated at 1% of gl
obal electricity consumption. Due to efficiency improvements,
the associated energy demand increased only modestly, by about 6% from 2000 to 2018. {Box 9.5}
System
-
wide effects endanger energy and GHG emission savings. Rising demand can diminish energy
sav
ings, and also produce run
-
away effects associated with additional consumption and GHG emissions
if left unregulated. Savings are varied in smart and shared mobility systems, as ride hailing increases
GHG emissions due to deadheading, whereas shared pooled
mobility and shared cycling reduce GHG
emissions, as occupancy levels and/or weight per person k
ilo
m
etre
transported improve. Systemic
effects have wider boundaries of analysis and are more difficult to quantify and investigate but are
nonetheless very re
levant. Systemic effects tend to have negative impacts
,
but policies and adequate
infrastructures and choice architectures can help manage and contain these
