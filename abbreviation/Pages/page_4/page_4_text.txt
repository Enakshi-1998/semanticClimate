B.1
Total net anthropogenic GHG emissions [FOOTNOTE 6] have continued to rise during
the period 2010
–
2019, as have cumulative net CO
2
emissions since 1850. Average annual GHG
emissions during 2010-2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth
between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009.

FOOTNOTE 6:
Net GHG emissions in this report refer to releases of greenhouse gases from
anthropogenic sources minus removals by anthropogenic sinks, for those species of gases that are
reported under the common reporting format of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC): CO
2
from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO
2
-FFI); net CO
2
emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (CO
2
-LULUCF); methane (CH
4
); nitrous oxide
(N
2
O); and fluorinated gases (F-gases) comprising hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
(PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Different datasets for GHG
emissions exist, with varying time horizons and coverage of sectors and gases, including some that go
back to 1850. In this report, GHG emissions are assessed from 1990, and CO
2
sometimes also from
1850. Reasons for this include data availability and robustness, scope of the assessed literature, and the
differing warming impacts of non-CO
2
gases over time.

Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions were 59±6.6 GtCO

about 12% (6.5 GtCO

average during the decade 2010–2019 was 56±6.0 GtCO

higher than in 2000-
2009. This is the highest increase in average decadal emissions on record. The average annual rate of
growth slowed from 2.1% yr

FOOTNOTE 7:
GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in
a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO
2
-equivalent (CO
2
-eq) using
the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the
contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the
analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the
complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {Chapter
2 SM 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, Box TS.2, WG I Chapter 7 Supplementary Material}
FOOTNOTE 8:
In this SPM, uncertainty in historic GHG emissions is reported using 90 % uncertainty
intervals unless stated otherwise. GHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a
consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur.
B.1.2
Growth in anthropogenic emissions has persisted across all major groups of GHGs since 1990,
albeit at different rates. By 2019, the largest growth in absolute emissions occurred in CO
2
from fossil
fuels and industry followed by CH
4
, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases,
starting from low levels in 1990 (
high confidence
). Net anthropogenic CO
2
emissions from land use,
land-use change and forestry (CO
2
-LULUCF) are subject to large uncertainties and high annual
variability, with
low confidence
even in the direction of the long-term trend
[FOOTNOTE 9]. (Figure
SPM.1) {Figure 2.2, Figure 2.5, 2.2, Figure TS.2}
FOOTNOTE 9:
Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals
occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Currently, net CO
2
fluxes from land reported by global
book-keeping models used here are estimated to be about ~5.5 GtCO
2

higher than the aggregate
