A systemic perspective on technological change can provide insights to policymakers supporting
their selection of effective innovation policy instruments

These
innovation policy instruments would nonetheless have to be tailored to local
development priorities, to
the specific context of different countries, and to the technology being supported. The timing of
interventions and any trade

offs with sustainable development also need to be addressed.
Public R&D
funding and support as well as innovation procurement have shown to be valuable for fostering
innovation in small to medium cleantech firms

{16.4.4.3}. Innovation outcomes of
policy instruments not necessarily aimed at innovation,
such as feed

in tariffs, auctions, emissions
trading schemes, taxes and renewable portfolio standards, vary from negligible to positive for climate
change mitigation. Some specific designs of environmental taxation can also result in negative

al outcomes {16.4.4}. Most of the available literature and evidence on innovation systems
come from industrialised countries and larger developing countries. However, there is a growing body
of evidence from developing countries and small island developing
states (SIDS
