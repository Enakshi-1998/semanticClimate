AR6) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Working Group I (Chapter 7). The fraction of global emissions for
each gas is shown 1990, 2000, 2010, 2019; as well as the aggregate average annual growth rate between these
decades. At the right side of Panel a, GHG emissions in 2019 are broken down into individual components with
the associated uncertainties [90% confidence interval] indicated by the error bars: CO

indicate the uncertainty range. Uncertainty ranges as shown here are specific for individual groups of greenhouse
gases and cannot be compared. The table shows the central estimate for: absolute emissions in 2019, the absolute
change in emissions between 1990 and 2019, and emissions in 2019 expressed as a percentage of 1990 emissions.
