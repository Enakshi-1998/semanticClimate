Emissions growth has varied, but has persisted

The a

any previous decade for each group of greenhouse gases (

Globally,
Gross Domestic Product (
GDP
)
per capita and population growth remained the
strongest drivers of CO
2
emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade
(
high confidence
).
Trends
since 1990 continued in the years 2010 to 2019 with GDP per capita and population growth
increasing emissions
by 2.3% and 1.2%
yr

, respectively. This growth outpaced the reduction in the
use of energy per unit
of GDP (

energy
(

Emissions of GHGs are weighed by Global Warming Potentials with a 100 year time horizon
(GWP
100
) from the Sixth Assessment Report. GWP100 is commonly used in wide
parts of the literature on
climate change mitigation and is required for reporting emissions under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). All metrics have limitations and uncertainties. {
