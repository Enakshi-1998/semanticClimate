AR6 WGIII
Due to its much shorter lifetime, methane has disproportionate impact on near
-
term temperature, and is
estimated to account for almost a third of the warming observed to date
(AR6 WG1
SPM
; WG
-
III Chapter
2
,
Figure 2.4)
. Methane reductions could be particularly important in relation to near
-
and medium
-
term
temperatures, including through counteracting the impact of reducing short
-
lived aerosol pollutants which
have an average cooling effec
t.

The land

use component of CO
2
emissions has different drivers and particularly large uncertainties (Chapter
2
,
Figures 2.2, 2.5), hence is shown separately. Also, c
ompared to AR5, new evidence showed that the
AFOLU CO
2
estimates by the global models a
ssessed in this report are not necessarily comparable with
national GHG inventories, due to different approaches to estimate the 'anthropogenic' CO
2
sink. Possible
ways to reconcile these discrepancies are discussed in Chapter 7.

10% over the period in each
case (

In total, developed country emissions barely changed from 2010, whilst those from the
rest of the world grew.
Figure 1.2 shows the distribution of regional CO
2
(GHG emissions) (a) per capita and (b) per GDP based
on purchasing power parity (GDP
ppp
) of di
fferent country groupings in 2019. Plotted against population and
GDP respectively, the area of each block is proportional to the region’s emissions. Compared to the
equivalent presentations in 2004 (AR4, SPM.3) and 2010 (AR5, Figure 1.8),

substantially the biggest group, whilst at about 8(/10tCO

capita
remain
about half that of north America. In contrast, a third of the world’s population, in southern Asia and Africa,
emit on average under 2 (2.5tCO

per person, little more than in the previous Assessments. Particularly
for these regions there continue to be substantial differences in the GDP, life expectancy and other measures
of wellbeing (see Figure 1.

Indeed, cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols (organic carbon, black carbon, sulphates, nitrates),
which are also important components of local air pollution
(Myhre et al. 2013; WGI SPM D1.7)
may in global average
be of similar magnitude to warming from methane at present. Mitigation which reduces such
aerosol masking could
thereby increase global temperatures, and reducing methane emissions would offset this much more rapidly than
reducing CO
(WGI
SPM D1.7). Methane is thus particularly important in determining whether or when 1.5C is reached for
2
because of its relatively short lifetime, with the combined effects which could counterbalance each other
example.

emissions in 2018 were below 2010 levels in 32 developed countries, but only in 24 when including
other GHGs. Reductions were by less than 1

2.11 for panel of countries that have sustained territorial emission reductions longer than 10 years, as analysed in
Lamb et al.
(2021)
, and decomposition analysis of national trends in Xia et al.
(2021)
. The previously rising trend of
‘outsourced/embodied emissions’ associated with goods imported into developed countrie
