Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs)
used in AR6
–
illustration of key features and levels of
ambition
The IMPs are organized around two dimensions: the
level of ambition
consistent with meeting Paris goals
and the
scenario features (
Figure 1.4)
.
The IMPs explore different pathways potent
ially consistent with
meeting the long
-
term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. As detailed in
Sect
ion 3.2.5 of
Chapter 3
and
Chapter
4, a pathway of Gradual Strengthening of current policies (
IMP
-
GS
) to 2030, if followed by
very fast reductions, may stay below 2C.
The
IMP
-
NEG
pathway, with somewhat deeper emission
cutbacks to 2030, might enable 1.5C to be reached but only after significant overshoot, through the
subsequent
extensive use of CDR
in th
e energy and the industry sectors to achieve
net
negative
global
emissions, as discussed in Chapters 3, 12, 7, 6, and 10.
Three other IMPs illustrate different features of te
chnology scenarios with more short term rapid emission
reductions, which could deliver outcomes compatible with the temperature range in the Paris agreement
without large overshoot. Based on the assessment in
Section 5.3.3 of
Chapter 5, one key mitigation
strategy
would be to rely on the opportunities for reducing demand (
IMP
-
LD
). Chapter 6 and the Chapter 7
-
11 show
how energy systems based on
accelerated
deep renewable energy penetration and electrification can also
provide a pathway to deep mitigation (
IM
P
-
REN
). Chapter 4, 17 and 3 provide insights how shifting
development
pathways
can lead to deep emission reductions and achieve sustainable development goals
(
IMP
-
SP
)
.
These pathways can be implemented with different levels of ambition, that can be measured through the
classes (C) of temperature levels from the scenarios database, see Chapter 3 (Table
3.2
). In the IMP
framework,
Section 3.2.5 in
Chapter 3 presents and ex
plores quantitative scenarios that can limit warming
to 1.5
°
C (with a probability of 50% or greater, i.e., C1 for the illustrated quantification of LD, SP and REN,
and C2 for NEG scenario), along with others GS pathway which keeps warming below 2
o
C with a
probability of 67% or greater (C3). In addition to these primary IMPs, the full scenario database contains
sensitivity cases that explore alternative warming levels.
In addition to the IMPs two additional scenarios were selected, which illustrate the con
sequences of current
policies and pledges. Current Policies (
CurPol
) explores the consequences of continuing along the path of
implemented climate policies in 2020 and only a gradual strengthening after that, drawing on numerous
such scenarios in the liter
ature. Moderate Action (
ModAct
)
explores the impact of implementing NDCs
to
2030
, but without further strengthening; both results in global mean temperature above 2
o
C. The
y
provide
benchmarks against which to compare the IMPs.
