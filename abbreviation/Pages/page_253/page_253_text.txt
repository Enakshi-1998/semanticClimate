, however, equity and ethics are both a driver of and
constraint on mitigation.
1.7.2.1
Ethics and values
A large body of literature examines the critical role of values, ethics, attitudes, and behaviours as
foundat
ional frames for understanding and assessing climate action, sustainable development and
societal transformation
(IPCC WGIII IPCC 2014a chapter 3)
. Most of this work is offered as a counter
point or critique to mainstream literature’s focus on safe
-
guarding of economic growth of nations,
corporations and
individuals
(Castree 2017; Gunster 2017)
. These perspectives highlight the dominance
of economic utilitarianism in western philosophical thought as a ke
y driver for unsustainable
consumption and global environmental change
(Hoeing et al. 2015; Po
pescu 2016)
.
Entrenching alter
n
ative values that promote deep decarbonisation, environmental conservation and
protection across all levels of society is
then
viewed as foundational component of climate resilient and
sustainable development and for achieving human rights, and a safe clim
ate world
(Jolly et al. 2015;
Evensen 2015; Popescu 2016; Tàbara et al. 2019)
.
The UN Human Rights Office of the High
Commissioner has highlighted the pot
entially crucial role of human rights in relation to climate change
(
UNHCR 2018)
.
While acknowledging the role of policy, technology, and finance,
the
‘managerialist’
approaches that emphasise ‘technical governanc
e’ and fail to challenge the deeper values that underpin
societies
may
not secure the deep change required to avert dangerous climate change and other
environmental challenges
(Hartzell
-
Nichols 2014; Steinberger et al. 2020)
.
S
ocial justice
perspectives emphasise
the distribution of responsibilities, rights, and mutual obligations
between nations in navigating societal transformations
(Patterson et al. 2018; Gawel and Kuhlicke 2017;
Leach et al. 2018)
.
C
urrent approaches to climate action
may
fail to match what i
s required by science
because they tend to circumvent constraints on human behaviour, especially constraints on economic
interest and activity.
Related literature explores
governance models that are centred on environmental
limits, planetary boundaries a
nd the moral imperative to prioritise the poor in earth systems governance
(Carley and Konisky 2020; Kashwa
n et al. 2020)
, with emphasis on
trust and solidarity as foundations
for global co
-
operation on climate change
(Jolly et al. 2015)
.
A
key obstacle is that
the economic
interests
of states
tend to be str
onger than
the drivers
for urgent
climate
action
(Bain 2017)
.
S
hort

s
of
stakeholders
is acknowledged
to
impede the
reflection and deliberation needed
for climate mitigation and adaptation planning
(Hackmann 2016; Herrick 2018; Sussman et al. 2016;
Schlosberg et al. 2017)
.
S
ituationally appropriate mitigation and adaptation polic
ies
at both national
and
international level
may require more ethical self

(Herrick 2018)

environmental behaviours
(Howell and Allen 2017; Jonsson and Nilsson 2014; Katz

Gerro et al.
2015; Braito et al. 2017)
.
Another strong theme in the literature concerns recognition of interdependence including the intimate
relationship between humans and the non
-
human world
(Hannis 2016; Gupta and Racherla 2018;
Howell and Allen
2017)
, with such ecological interdependence offered as an organising principle for
enduring transformation to sustainability. A key policy implication of this is moving away from valuing
nature only in market and monetary terms to strongly incorporatin
g existential and non

material value
of nature in natural resource accounting
(Neuteleers and Engelen 2015; Himes

Cornell et al. 2018;
Shackleton et al. 2017)

frameworks to

(Kasperbauer 2016; Nash et al. 2017; Xiang et al. 2019)
. In such a
framework, moderation, fairness, and stewardship are all understood and promoted as directly
