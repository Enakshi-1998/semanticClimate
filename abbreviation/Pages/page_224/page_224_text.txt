After
decades of global progress in reducing
poverty, COVID
-
19 has pus
hed hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds and raises the
spectre of intersecting health and climate crises that are devas
tating for the most vulnerable (

.1.2 Box 5.1)
.
Like those of
climate change, pandemic impacts fall heavily on disadv
antaged groups, exacerbate the
uneven distribution of future benefits, amplify existing inequities, and introduce new
ones
.
Increased
poverty also hinders efforts towards sustainable low

Renewables were the o
nly energy sector to increase output
(IEA 2020a)
. Within the context of a wider
overall
reduction in energy investment this prompted a substantial
r
elative
shift towards low carbon
investment particularly by the private sector
(IEA 2020b; Rosembloom and Markard 2020; 15.2.1, 15.3.1,
15.6.1)

pandemic recovery pathways provide an opportunity to attract finance into accelerated and

In most countries,
COVID

19 has
increased
unemployment and/or state

supported employment. There is a profound difference between short

‘bail

outs’ to stem unemployment, and the orientation of new public investment. The public debt is mirrored
by large pools of private capital.

economic multipliers of

, so much so that f

(Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2013

.
Recovery packages are
motivated by assessments that investing in can boost the macroeconomic
effectiveness (‘multipliers’) of publ
ic spending, crowd

in and revive private investment
(Hepburn et al.
2020
).
There are clear reasons why a low
-
carbon response can create more enduring jobs, better aligned to
future growth sectors: by also crowding
-
in and reviving private investment (e.g. from capital markets and
institut
ional investors, including the growing profile of Environment and Social Governance (ESG) and
green bond markets (15.6)), this can boost the effectiveness of public spending
(IMF 2020)
.
Stern and
Valero
(Stern and Valero 2021)
argue that investment in low
-
carbon innovation and its diffusion,
complemented
by investments in
s
ustainable infrastructure,
are key to shape
environmentally sustainable
and inclusive
growth in the aftermath of the COVID
-
19 pandemic crisis. This would be the case both for
high
-
income
economies on the global innovation frontier,
and to promote sustainab
le development in
poorer economies.
A study with a global general equilibrium model
(
Liu et al. 2021)
finds that because the COVID

19
economic aftermath combines negative impacts on employment and consumption, a shift from employment
and consumption taxes to carbon or other resource

related taxes would enhance GDP by 1.7% in 2021

Keynesian model of wider
‘green recovery’ policies
(Pollitt et al. 2021)
finds a short

‘no policy’), and
