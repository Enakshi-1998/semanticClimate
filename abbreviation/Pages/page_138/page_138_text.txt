, which shows
changes in
driver variables of population, sufficiency (floor area per capita), efficiency (final energy per floor area), and
renewables (GHG emissions per final energy). ‘Renewables’ is a summary term describing changes
in GHG
intensity of energy supply. Emission projections to 2050, and differences between scenarios in 2050,
demonstrate mitigation potentials from the dimensions of the SER framework realised in each model scenario.
In most regions, historical improvements
in efficiency have been approximately matched by growth in floor area
per capita. Implementing sufficiency measures that limit growth in floor area per capita, particularly in
developed regions, reduces the dependence of climate mitigation on technologica
l solutions

The development, since AR5, of integrated approaches to
the
construction and retrofit of
buildings has led to increasing the number of zero energy
or zero
carbon buildings in almost all
climate zones.

The
decarbonisation of buildings is constrained by multiple barrier
s and obstacles as well as
limited
finance
flow
s
(
high confidence
). The lack of institutional capacity, especially in developing
countries, and appropriate governance structures slow down the decarbonisation of the global
building stock (
medium confidence
)
.
The building sector
is highly heterogenous with
many different
building types, sizes, and operational uses.
The sub
-
segment representing rented property faces
principal/agent problems where the tenant benefits from the decarbonisation’s investment made b
y the
landlord.
The organisational context and the governance structure could trigger or hinder the
decarbonisation of buildings.
Global investment in the decarbonisation of buildings was estimated at
USD
164 billion in 2020. However, this is not enough
by far
to close the investment gap (
high
confidence
)
.

Policy packages could grasp the full mitigation potential of the global building stock. Building
energy codes
represent the main regulatory instrum
ent to reduce emissions from both new and
existing buildings (
high confidence
).
The
most
advanced building energy codes include requirements
on each of the three pillars of the SER framework in the
use
and
construction
phase of buildings.
Building energy c
odes
have
proven to be effective if compulsory and combined with other regulatory
instruments such as minimum energy performance standard for appliances and equipment, if the
performance level is set at the level of the best available technologies in the m
arket (
high confidence
).
Market
-
based instruments such as carbon taxes with recycling of the revenues and personal or building
carbon allowances
could
also contribute to foster
ing
the decarbonisation of the building sector (
medium
confidence
)

Expected
heatwaves
will inevitably increase cooling needs to limit the health impacts of climate change
(
medium confidence
).
G
lobal warming will impact cooling and heating n
eeds but also the performance,
durability and safety of buildings, especially historical and coastal ones, through changes in
temperature, humidity,
atmospheric
concentrations of CO
2
and chloride, and sea level rise. Adaptation
measures to cope with climat
e change may increase the demand for energy and materials leading to an
increase in GHG emissions if not mitigated.
Sufficiency measures which
anticipate
climate
change
, and
include natural ventilation, white walls, and nature
-
based solutions (
e.g.
green r
oofs) will decrease the
demand for cooling. Shared cooled spaces with highly efficient cooling solutions are among the
mitigation strategies which can limit the effect of the expected heatwaves on people’s health
