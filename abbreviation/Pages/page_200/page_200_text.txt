level assessment for selected mitigation options. Ove
rlaps may exist in the
mitigation options assessed and presented by sector and system, and feasibility might differ depending on the
demarcation of that option in each sector.
Chapters 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 assess mitigation response options across
six feasibility dimensions:
geophysical, environmental
-
ecological, technological, economic, socio
-
cultural and
institutional
. AFOLU (Ch7) and industry (Ch11) are not included because of
the heterogeneity of options in
these sectors. For each dimension, a set of feasibility indicators was identified. Examples of indicators include
impacts on land use, air pollution, economic costs, technology scalability, public acceptance and political
acceptance (see Box TS.1
5
, and Annex II Part IV Section 11 for a detailed explanation).
An indicator could
refer to a barrier or an enabler to implementation, or could refer to both a barrier or an enabler, depending on the
context, speed, and scale of imp
lementation.
Dark blue bars indicate the extent of enablers to deployment within
each dimension. This is shown relative to the maximum number of possible enablers, as indicated by the light
blue shading. Dark orange bars indicate the extent of barriers to
deployment within each dimension. This is
shown relative to the maximum number of possible barriers, as indicated by light orange shading. A light grey
dot indicates that there is limited or no evidence to assess the option. A dark grey dot indicates that
one of the
feasibility indicators within that dimension is not relevant for the deployment of the option. T
he relevant
sections in the underlying chapters
include references to the literature on which the assessment is based
and
indicate whether the feasi
bility of an option varies depending on context (e.g., region), scale (e.g., small,
medium, full scale), speed (e.g., implementation in 2030 versus 2050) and warming level (e.g., 1.5°C versus
2°C).
