Industry
The
industry c
hapter
focuses on new developments
since AR5
and
emphasi
s
es
the role of
the energy
-
intensive
and emissions
-
intensive basic materials industries
in
strategies for reaching net
zero
emissions.
The Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the COVID
-
19 pandemic
provide a new context for the
evolution of industry and mitigation of industry greenhouse
gas
(GHG) emissions
(high confidence)
.
{11.1.1}
Net zero CO

industrial sector
emissions are possible but
challenging
(high confidence).
Energy
efficiency will continue to be important. Reduced materials demand, material efficiency, and circular
economy solutions can reduce the need for primary production. Primary production options include
switching to new processes that use low to zero G
HG energy carriers and feedstocks (e.g., electricity,
hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon
dioxide
capture and utili
s
ation (CCU)
to provide
carbon feedstock
s
)
.
C
arbon capture and storage (CCS)
will be required
to mitigate
remaining CO
2
emissions
{11.3}. These
op
tions require substantial scaling up of electricity, hydrogen, recycling, CO
2
, and other infrastructure,
as well as phase
-
out or conversion of existing industrial plants. While improvements in the GHG
intensities of major basic materials have nearly stagna
ted over the last 30 years, analysis of historical
technology shifts and newly available technologies indicate these intensities can be
significantly
reduced by mid
-
century. {11.2, 11.3, 11.4}
I
ndustr
y sector
emissions have been growing faster since 2000 t
han emissions in any other sector,
driven by increased basic materials extraction and
production
(high confidence)
.
GHG emissions
attributed to the industrial sector originate from fuel combustion, process emissions, product use and
waste
,
which jointly ac
counted for 14.1 GtCO
2
-
eq or 2
4
% of all direct anthropogenic emissions in 2019,
second
behind the energy
supply
sector
. Industry is a leading GHG emitter
-
20 GtCO

-
eq or 34% of
global emissions in 2019
-
if indirect emissions from power and heat
generation are included. The share
of emissions originating from direct fuel combustion is decreasing and was 7 GtCO

industrial emissions in 2019. {11.2.2}
Global material intensity

use stock of manufactured capital

is increasing
(high confidence)
.
In
-
use stock of manufactured capital per capita has been growing
faster than GDP per capita since 2000. Total global in
-
use stock of manufactured capital grew by 3.4%

in 2000
–
2019. At the same time, per
capita material stocks in several developed countries have
stopped growing, showing a decoupling from GDP per capita. {11.2.1, 11.3.1}
The
demand
for p
lastic has been growing
most
strong
ly
since 1970
(high confidence)
.
The current
>99% reliance on fossil feedstock, very low recycling, and high emissions from petrochemical
processes is a challenge for reaching net
zero emissions. At the same time, plastics are important for
reducing emissions elsewhere, for
example, light
-
weighting vehicles. There are as yet no shared visions
for fossil
-
free plastics, but several possibilities. {11.4.1.3}
Scenario analyses show that significant
reductions
in global GHG emissions and even close to net
zero em
issions from GHG intensive industry (e.g., steel, plastics, ammonia, and cement) can be
achieved by 2050 by deploying multiple available and emerging
options
(medium confidence)
.
Significant
r
educ
tions
in
industry emissions require a reorientation from the
historic focus on important
but incremental improvements (e.g., energy efficiency) to transformational changes in energy and
feedstock sourcing, materials efficiency, and more circular material flows. {11.3, 11.4}
