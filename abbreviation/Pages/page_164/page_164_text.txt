Figure TS.21
legend:
Mitigation response options related to demand for services have been categorised into
three domains: ‘socio
-
cultural factors’, related to social norms, culture, and individual choices and behaviour;
‘infrastructure use’, related to the provision and use of supporting infrastructure that enables individual choices
and behaviour; and ‘technology adoption’, which refers to the uptake of technologies by end users.
Potentials in 2050 are estimated using th
e International Energy Agency’s 2020 World Energy Outlook STEPS
(Stated Policy Scenarios) as a baseline. This scenario is based on a sector
-
by
-
sector assessment of specific
policies in place, as well as those that have been announced by countries by mid
-
20
20. This scenario was
selected due to the detailed representation of options across sectors and sub
-
sectors.
The heights of the coloured columns represent the potentials on which there is a high level of agreement in the
literature, based on a range
of cas
e studies. The range shown by the dots connected by dotted lines represents the
highest and lowest potentials reported in the literature which have low to medium levels of agreement.

The
economic potential of

)
demand reduction through socio

cultural factors alone is 1.9 GtCO

without considering
land use change
by diversion of agricultural land from food production to carbon
sequestration
. If further changes in
land use enabled by
this change in demand
are
considered
, the
indicative
potential
could reach
7 GtCO

eq.
The electricity panel presents separately the mitigation potential from changes in electricity demand
and
changes
associated w
ith enhanced electrification in end use sectors. Electrification increases electricity demand,
while it is avoided though demand
-
side mitigation strategies. Load management refers to demand side flexibility
that can be achieved through incentive design lik
e time of use pricing/monitoring by artificial intelligence,
diversification of storage facilities etc. NZE (IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario) is used to compute the
impact of end use sector electrification, while the impact of demand side response
options is based on bottom
-
up
assessments.
Dark grey columns show the emissions that cannot be avoided through demand
-
side mitigation options.
The table indicates which demand
-
side mitigation options are included. Options are categorised according to:
soci
o
-
cultural factors, infrastructure use, and technology adoption.
