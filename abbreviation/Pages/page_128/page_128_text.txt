(

.
There is a large range in the forecasts of urban land expansion
across scenarios and models, which highlights an opportunity to shape future urban development
towards low
-
or net
zero GHG emissions. By 2050, urban areas could increase up to 211% over the
2015 global urban extent, with the median projected increase ranging from 43% to 106%. While the
largest absolute amount of new urban land is forecasted to occur in Asia and Developing Pacific, and
in Developed Countries, the highest rate of urban land gro
wth is projected to occur in Africa, Eastern
Europe and West
-
Central Asia, and in the Middle East.
G
iven past trends, the expansion of urban areas
is
expected
to take place on agricultural lands and forests, with implications for the loss of carbon
stocks.
The infrastructure that will be constructed concomitant with urban land expansion will lock

in
patterns of energy consumption that will persist for decades. {8.3.1, 8.3.4, 8.4.1, 8.6}
The construction of new, and upgrading of

The construction of new and upgrading of existing
urban infrastructure using conventional practices and technologies can result in significant
increase in

annually up to 2030 and more than double annual
resource requirements for raw materials to about 90 billion tonnes per year by 2050, up from 40 billion
tonnes in 2010.
{8.4.1, 8.6}
Given the dual challenges of rising urban GHG emissions and future projections of more frequent
extreme climate events, there is an urgent need to integrate urban mitigation and adaptation
strategies for cities to address climate
change
(very high confiden
ce).
Mitigation strategies can
enhance resilience against climate change impacts while contributing to social equity, public health,
and human well
-
being. Urban mitigation actions that facilitate economic decoupling can have positive
impacts on employment
and local economic competitiveness. {8.2,

Cities can achieve net
zero or near net
zero GHG emissions
only
through deep decarbonisation
and systemic
transformation
(very high confidence).
Effective emission reduc
tions in cities
entail
implementing three broad strategies concurrently: (1) reducing urban energy consumption across all
sectors, including through compact and efficient urban forms and supporting infrastructure; (2)
electrification and switching to
low c
arbon
energy
sources; and (3) enhancing carbon uptake and stocks
(
medium evidence, high agreement
). Given the regional and global reach of urban supply chains, a city
cannot achieve net
zero GHG emissions by only focusing on reducing emissions within
its
administrative boundaries. {8.1.6, 8.3.4, 8.4, 8.6}
Packages of mitigation policies that implement multiple urban
-
scale interventions can have
cascading effects across sectors, reduce GHG emissions outside a cityâ€™s administrative
boundaries, and reduce
emissions
more
than the net sum of individual interventions, particularly
if multiple scales of governance are
included
(high confidence).
Cities have the ability to implement
policy packages across sectors using an urban systems approach, especially thos
e that affect key
infrastructure based on spatial planning, electrification of the urban energy system, and urban green and
blue infrastructure. The institutional capacity of cities to develop, coordinate, and integrate sectoral
mitigation strategies withi
n their jurisdiction varies by context, particularly those related to governance,
the regulatory system, and budgetary control. {8.4, 8.5, 8.6}
Integrated spatial planning to achieve compact and resource

efficient urban growth through co
-
location of higher
residential and job densities, mixed land use, and transit
-
oriented development
could reduce
urban energy use
between 23

26% by 2050 compared to the business

as

scenario
(
