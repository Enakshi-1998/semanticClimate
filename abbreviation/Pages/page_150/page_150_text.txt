Bioenergy is the most land
-
intensi
ve energy option, but total land occupation of other renewable
energy options can
also
become significant in high deployment scenarios. While not as closely
connected to the AFOLU sector as bioenergy, other renewable energy options can influence
AFOLU acti
vities in both synergistic and detrimental
ways
(high confidence)
.
The character of land
occupation, and associated impacts, vary considerably among mitigation options and also for the same
option depending on geographic location, scale, system design and
deployment strategy. Land
occupation can be large uniform areas, e.g., reservoir hydropower dams and tree plantations, and more
distributed occupation that is integrated with other land uses, e.g., wind turbines and agroforestry in
agriculture landscapes.
Deployment can be partly decoupled from additional land use, e.g., use of
organic waste and residues and integration of solar PV into buildings and other infrastructure (
high
confidence
). Wind and solar power can coexist with agriculture in
beneficial ways (
medium confidence
).
Indirect land occupation includes new agriculture
areas
following displacement of food production with
bioenergy plantations and expansion of mining activities providing minerals required for manufacture
of EV batteries
, PV, and wind power.

The deployment of land
-
based mitigation measures can provide co
-
benefits, but there are also
risks and trade
-
offs
fro
m
inappropriate land management (
high confidence
). Such risks can best
be managed if AFOLU mitigation is
pursued in response to the needs and perspectives of multiple
stakeholders to achieve outcomes that
maximi
s
e
synergies while limiting trade
-
offs (
medium
confidence
).
The results of implementing AFOLU measures are often variable and highly context
specific.
Depending on local conditions (e.g., ecosystem, climate, food system, land ownership) and
management strategies (e.g., scale, method), mitigation measures
can
positively or negatively
affect
biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, water availabi
lity and quality, soil productivity, rights
infringements, food security, and human well
-
being.
The agriculture and forestry sectors can devise
management approaches that enable biomass production and use for energy in conjunction with the
production of food and timber, thereby reducing the conversion pressure on natural ecosystems (
medium
confidence
).
Mitigation measures addressing GHGs may also affect other climate forcers such as albedo
and evapotranspiration. Integrated responses that co
ntribute to mitigation, adaptation, and other land
challenges will have greater likelihood of being successful (
high confidence
); measures which provide
additional benefits to biodiversity and human well
-
being are sometimes described as ‘Nature
-
based
Solut
ions’. {7.1, 7.4, 7.6

AFOLU mitigation measures have been well understood for decades but deployment remains
slow
,
and emissions trends indicate unsatisfactory progress despite beneficial contributions to
global emissions reduction from forest
-
related
options (
high confidence
).
Globally, the AFOLU
sector has so far contributed modestly to net mitigation, as past policies have delivered about 0.65
GtCO
2
yr
-
1
of mitigation during 2010
–
2019 or 1.4% of global gross emissions. The majority (>80%) of
emission reduction resulted from forestry measures.
Although the mitigation potential of AFOLU
measures is large from a biophysical and ecological perspective, its feasibility is hampered by lack of
institutional support, uncertainty over long
-
term additi
onality and trade
-
offs, weak governance,
fragmented land ownership, and uncertain permanence effects. Despite these impediments to change,
AFOLU mitigation options are demonstrably effective and with appropriate support can enable rapid
emission reductions
in most countries. {7.4, 7.6}
Concerted, rapid and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from policy makers and investors to
land
-
owners and managers is a pre
-
requisite
for
achieving high levels of mitigation in the AFOLU
sector (
high
confidence
).
To date
USD0.7 billion yr
-
1
is estimated to have been spent on AFOLU
mitigation. This is well short of the more than USD400 billion yr
-
1
that is estimated to be necessary to
deliver the up to 30% of global mitigation effort envisaged
in deep mitigation scenarios
(
medium
confidence)
. This estimate of the global funding requirement is smaller than current subsidies provided
