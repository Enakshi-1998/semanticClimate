and operations that take into account energy demand and system constra
ints across all sectors (transport,
buildings, and industry) offer the opportunity to leverage sectoral synergies and avoid inefficient
allocation of energy resources. Integrated planning of transport and power infrastructure would be
particularly useful i
n developing countries where ‘greenfield’ development doesn’t suffer from
constraints imposed by legacy systems. {10.3, 10.4, 10.8}
The deployment of low
-
carbon aviation and shipping fuels that support decarbonisation of the
transport sector could require
changes to national and international governance structures
(
medium confidence
).
T
he
UNFCCC
does not specifically cover emissions from international shipping
and aviation.
Reporting
emissions from international transport is at the discretion of each country. While
the
International Civil Aviation Organi
s
ation
(
ICAO
)
and
International
Maritime
Organi
s
ation
(
IMO
)
have established emissions reductions targets, only strategies to improve
fuel efficiency and demand
reductions have been pursued, and there has been minimal commitment to new technologies. {10.5,
10.6, 10.7}
There are growing concerns about resource availability, labour rights
, non
-
climate
environmental impacts, and costs of cr
itical minerals needed for
l
ithium

b
atteries (
medium
confidence
).
Emerging national strategies on critical minerals and the requirements from major vehicle
manufacturers are leading to new, more geographically diverse mines. The standardisation of bat
tery
modules and packaging within and across vehicle platforms, as well as increased focus on design for
recyclability are important. Given the high degree of potential recyclability of
lithium

ion batterie
s
, a
nearly closed
-
loop system in the future could
mitigate concerns about critical mineral issues (
medium
confidence
). {10.3

Legislated climate strategies are emerging at all levels of government, and together with pledges
for personal choices, could spur the deployment of demand and supply
-
side transport mitigation
strategies (
medium confidence)
.
At the local level
,
legislation
can support local transport plans that
include
commitments or pledges from local institutions to encourage behaviour change by adopting an
organisational culture that motivates sustainable behaviour with inputs from the creative arts. Such
institution
-
led
mechanisms could include bike
-
to
-
work campaigns, free transport passes, parking
charges, or eliminating car benefits. Community
-
based solutions like
solar sharing
,
community
charging
, and
mobility as a service
can generate new opportunities to facilitate
low
-
carbon transport
futures. At the regional and national levels, legislation can include vehicle and fuel efficiency standards,
R&D
support, and large
-
scale investments in low
-
carbon transport infrastructure.
