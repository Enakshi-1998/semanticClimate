Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG
III
Greater contextualisation and granularity in policy approaches better addresses the challenges
of rapid
transitions towards zero
-
carbon systems (
high confidence
).
Larger systems take more time
to evolve, grow, and change compared to smaller ones
.
Creating and scaling up entirely new systems
takes longer than replacing existing technologies and practices.
Lat
e adopters tend to adopt faster than
early pioneers. Obstacles and feasibility barriers are high in the early transition phases. Barriers decrease
as a result of technical and social learning processes, network building, scale economies, cultural
debates,
and institutional adjustments. {

}
Mitigation policies that integrate and communicate with the values people hold are more
successful (
high confidence
).
Values differ between cultures. Measures that support autonomy, energy
security and safety, equity and environmental protection, and fairness resonate well in many
communities and social groups.
Changing
from a commercialised, individualised, entrepreneuri
al
training model to an education cognizant of planetary health and human well
-
being can accelerate
climate change awareness and action
.
{
5.4.1, 5.4.2
}
Changes in consumption choices that are supported by structural changes and political action
enable the
uptake of low
-
carbon choices (
high confidence
).
Policy instruments applied in
coordination can help to accelerate change in a consistent desired direction. Targeted technological
change, regulation, and public policy can help in steering digitali
s
ation, t
he sharing economy, and
circular economy towards climate change mitigation.

Complementarity in policies helps in the design of an optimal demand
-
side policy mix (
medium
confidence
).
In the case of energy efficiency, for
example, this may involve CO
2
pricing, standards and
norms, and information feedback.
