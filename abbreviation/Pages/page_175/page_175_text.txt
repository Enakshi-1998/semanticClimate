Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG
III
(robust evidence, medium agreement).
Flexible forms of regulation (e.g., performance standards) have
achieved aggregate goals for renewable energy generation, vehicle efficiency and fuel standards, and
energy efficienc
y in buildings and industry. Infrastructure investment decisions are significant for
mitigation because they lock in high
-
or low
-
emissions trajectories over long periods. Information and
voluntary programs can contribute to overall mitigation outcomes
(m
edium evidence, high agreement).
Designing for overlap and interactions among mitigation policies enhances their effectiveness.

National mitigation policies interact internationally with effects that both support and hinder
mitigation action
(medium
evidence, high agreement)
.
Reductions in demand for fossil fuels tend to
negatively affect fossil fuel exporting countries. Creation of markets for emission reduction credits
tends to benefit countries able to supply credits. Policies to support technolog
y development and
diffusion tend to have positive spill
over effects.
There is no consistent evidence of significant emissions
leakage or competitiveness effects between countries, including for emissions
-
intensive trade
-
exposed
industries covered by emiss
ion trading systems
(medium
confidence
)
.

Policy packages are better able to support socio
-
technical transitions and shifts in development
pathways toward low carbon futures than are individual policies
(
high confidence
).
For best effect,
they need to be harnessed to a clear vision for change and
designed with attention to local governance
context.
Comprehensiveness in coverage, coherence to ensure complementarity, and consistency of
policies with the overarching vision and its objectives are
important design
criteria. Integration
across
objective
s occurs when a
policy package is informed by a clear problem framing and identification of
the full range
of
relevant policy sub
-
systems
.
The climate policy landscape is
outlined
in Table TS.8,
which maps
framings of desired
national
policy
outcomes
to

approaches.

The co
-
benefits and trade
-
offs of integrating adaptation and mitigation are most usefully
identified and assessed prior to policy making rather than being accidentally discovered
(
high
confidence
).
T
his requires strengthening relevant national institutions to reduce silos and overlaps,
increasing knowledge exchange at the country and regional levels, and supporting engagement with
bilateral and multilateral funding partners. Local governments are well
placed to develop policies that
generate social and environmental co
-
benefits but to do so require legal backing and adequate capacity
and resources.

Climate change mitigation is accelerated when attention is given to integrated policy and economy
wide approaches, and when enabling conditions (
governance, institutions, behaviour
and
lifestyle
,
innovation, policy,
and
finance
)
, are present
(robust evidence, medium agreement)
.
Accelerating
climate mitigation includes simultaneously weakening high
carbon systems and encouraging low
carbon systems; ensuring interaction between adjacent systems (e.g.
,
energy and agriculture);
overcoming resistance to policies (e.g., from incumbents in high carbon emitting industries), including
by providing transition
al support to the vulnerable and negatively affected by distributional impacts;
inducing changes in consumer practices and routines; providing transition support; and addressing
coordination challenges in policy and governance.
