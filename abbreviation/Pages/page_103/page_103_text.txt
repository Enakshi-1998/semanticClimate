Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
Each o
f the IMPs comprises: a
storyline
and a
quantitative illustration
. The
storyline
describes
the key
characteristics of the pathway
qualitatively
; the
quantitative illustration
is selected from the literature
on long
-
term scenarios
to
effectively represent the
IMP
numerically.
The f
ive Illustrative Mitigation
Pathways (IMPs)
each emphasise
a different scenario element as its defining feature
, and are named
accordingly
: heavy reli
ance on
ren
ewables (IMP
-
Ren), strong emphasis on
l
ow
d
emand
for
energy
(IMP
-
LD),
extensive use of
Carbon Dioxide Removal (
CDR
)
in the energy and the industry sectors to
achieve net negative emissions
(IMP
-
Neg), mitigation in the context of broader sustainable
development
and
s
hifting
development
p
athways
(IMP
-
SP), and the implications of a less rapid and
g
radual
s
trengthening of near
-
term mitigation actions (IMP
-
GS).
In some cases, sectoral chapters m
ay
use different quantifications that follow the same storyline narrative but contain data that better
exemplify the chapter’s assessment. Some IMP
variants are also used
to explore the sensitivity
around
alternative temperature goals.

The
two
additional
p
athways
i
llustrative of higher emissions
are
c
urrent
p
olicies
(
CurPol
)
and

a
ction
(
ModAct
).
This framework is summarised in Box TS.

The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
First published in 2017, the
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
are alternative projections of
socio
-
economic developments that may influence future GHG emissions.
The initial set of SSP narratives described worlds with different challenges to mitigation and adaptation:
SSP1 (
sustainability
), SSP2 (
middle of the road
), SSP3 (
regional rivalry
), SSP4
(
inequality
) and SSP5
(
rapid growth
). The SSPs were subsequently quantified in terms of energy, land
-
use change, and
emission pathways
for both
i)
no
-
climate
-
policy reference scenarios and
ii)
mitigation scenarios that
