Limit to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot: Pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or
limited overshoot (C1, Table SPM.1 C1). All these pathways assume immediate action after 2020.
Past GHG emissions for 2010-2015 used to project global warming outcomes of the modelled pathways are
shown by a black line
[FOOTNOTE 33] and past global GHG emissions in 2015 and 2019 as assessed in
Chapter 2 are shown by whiskers.
FOOTNOTE 33:
See the Box SPM.1 for a description of the approach to project global warming outcomes of
modelled pathways and its consistency between the climate assessment in AR6 WG I.
Panels b, c and d show snapshots of the GHG emission ranges of the modelled pathways in 2030, 2050, and
2100, respectively. Panel b also shows projected emissions outcomes from near-term policy assessments in 2030
from Chapter 4.2 (Tables 4.2 and 4.3; median and full range). GHG emissions are in CO
2
-equivalent using
GWP100 from AR6 WG I. {3.5, 4.2, Tables 4.2 and 4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4}

Projected cumulative future CO
2
emissions over the lifetime of existing and currently
planned fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net
CO
2
emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot.
They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO
2
emissions in pathways that limit
warming to 2°C (>67%). (

If historical operating patterns are maintained,
[FOOTNOTE 34] and without additional
abatement [FOOTNOTE 35], estimated cumulative future CO
2
emissions from existing fossil fuel
infrastructure, the majority of which is in the power sector, would, from 2018 until the end of its
lifetime, amount to 660 [460–890] GtCO
2
. They would amount to 850 [600–1100] GtCO
2
when
unabated emissions from currently planned infrastructure in the power sector is included. These
estimates compare with cumulative global net CO
2
emissions from all sectors of 510 [330–710] GtCO
2
until the time of reaching net zero CO
2
emissions
[FOOTNOTE 36] in pathways that limit warming to
1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and 890 [640–1160] GtCO
2
in pathways that limit warming
to 2°C (>67%). (Table SPM.1) (

FOOTNOTE 34:
Historical operating patterns are described by load factors and lifetimes of fossil fuel
installations as observed in the past (average and range).
FOOTNOTE 35
: Abatement here refers to human interventions that reduce the amount of greenhouse
gases that are released from fossil fuel infrastructure to the atmosphere.
FOOTNOTE 36:
Total cumulative CO
2
emissions up to the time of global net zero CO
2
emissions are
similar but not identical to the remaining carbon budget for a given temperature limit assessed by
Working Group I. This is because the modelled emission scenarios assessed by Working Group III
cover a range of temperature levels up to a specific limit, and exhibit a variety of reductions in non-CO
2
emissions that also contribute to overall warming. {Box 3.4}
B.7.2
In modelled global pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, most remaining fossil
fuel CO
2
emissions until the time of global net zero CO
2
emissions are projected to occur outside the
power sector, mainly in industry and transport. Decommissioning and reduced utilisation of existing
