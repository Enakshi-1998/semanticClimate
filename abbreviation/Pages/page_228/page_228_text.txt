The ‘nexus’ between
energy, water, and land
–
all
key contributors to human
well
-
being
–
also help
s to
provide, regulate and support
ecosystem and cultural services
(Bazilian
et al. 2011; Ringler et al. 2013;
Smajgl et al. 2016; Albrecht et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Brouwer et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al.
2019)
, with important
implications
for
cities in
managing
new systems of transformation
(Chapter 8;
Thornbush et al. 2013; Wolfram et al. 2016)
.
Other important
nexus
’
shaping our planet’s future
(Fajardy
et al. 2018)
include agriculture, forestry, land use and ecosystem services
(Chazdon 2008; Keesstra et al.
2018; Nesshöver et al. 2017; Torralba et al. 2016; Settele et al. 2016)
.
Historically, energy
-
related
GHG emissions were considered a by
-
product of the increasing scale of human
activity, driven by population size
,
economic activity
and technology.
That simple notion has evolved
greatly over time to become much more complex and diverse, with increasing fo
cus on the provision of
energy
services
(Garrett et al. 2020; Bardi et al. 2019; Cullen and Allwood 2010; Brockway et al. 2019)
)
The
demand for agricultural prod
ucts
has
historically
driven
conversion of natural lands (land use change).
AFOLU
along with food processing
account for
21
-
37% of total net anthropogenic GHG emissions
(
SRCCL SPM A3
)

Continued growth in population and income are expected to continue dr
iving up demand for goods and
services
(
Chapters 2, 3 & 5
)
, with an important role for urbanisation which is proceeding at an
unprecedented speed and scale. In the last decade, the urban population grew by 70 million people each
year, or about 1.3
million people per week, with urban area expanding by about 102 km
2
per day
(
Chapter
8
)
. Urban areas account for most (45
-
87%) of the global carbon footprint
(
8.1
)
and the strong and positive
correlation between urbanisation and incomes means higher consum
ption from urban lifestyles will
continue driving direct and indirect GHG emissions. Cities provide conduit to many of the services such as
transportation, housing, water, food, medical care, recreation and other services and urban carbon emissions
are dri
ven not only by population and income but also by form and structure of urban areas
(
8.1, 8.3, 8.4,
8.5, 8.6
)
. This creates opportunities for decarbonization through urban planning and purposeful
“experimentation”
(Newman et al. 2017 Chapter 8)
.
Human needs and wants evolve over tim
e making the transition toward climate and sustainable
development goals either more or less difficult. For example, changes in the composition of goods
consumed, such as, shifting diets toward a more vegetarian balance, can reduce land
-
use emissions witho
ut
compromising the quality of life
(Stehfest et al. 2009; van Vuuren et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019;
Hargreaves et al. 2021; Gough 2017; SRCCL SPM B2.3)
.
Human behavior and choices,
including joint achievement of wider social goals
, will play
an important part
in enabling or hindering climate mitigation
and
sustainable development
(Shi et al. 2016)
, for example
shifting passenger transportation preferences
in ways that combine
climate
, health
and sustainable
development goals
(Romanello et al. 2021)
.
1.4.2
Trade, consumption and leakage
Emissions associated with international trade account for 20
-
33 % of global emissions, as calculated using
multi
-
regional input
-
output analysis
(Wiedmann and Lenzen 2018)
.
Whether international trade drives
increase or decrease in global GHG emissions depends on emissions intensity of traded products as well as
the influence of trade on relocation of productio
n
, with studies reaching diverse conclusions about the net
effect of
trade openness on
CO
2
emissions (Section 2.4.5). Tariff reduction of low carbon technologies

AFOLU accounted for about 13% of CO2, 44% of CH4 and 82% of N2O global anthropogenic GHG
emissions in 2007

2016 (SRCCL SPM A3).
