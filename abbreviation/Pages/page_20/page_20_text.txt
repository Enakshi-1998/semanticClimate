37] switches to low carbon fuels, and cancellation of new coal installations without CCS are major
options that can contribute to aligning future CO

emissions from the power sector with emissions in
the assessed global modelled least-cost pathways. The most appropriate strategies will depend on
national and regional circumstances, including enabling conditions and technology availability. (

: In this context, capture rates of new installations with CCS are assumed to be 90-
95% + {11.3.5}. Capture rates for retrofit installations can be comparable, if plants are specifically
designed for CCS retrofits {11.3.6}.
