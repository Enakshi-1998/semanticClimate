. Choices that cause cli
mate change as well as the processes
for making and
implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non

nation state actors such as
cities
,
businesses,
and civil society organisations. At global, national and subnational levels, climate change actions are
interwoven with and embedded in the context of much broader social, economic and political goals.
Therefore
, the governance required to ad
dress climate change has to navigate power, political,
economic, and social dynamics at all levels of decision making.

Introduction
Th
is Report (WGIII)
aims to assess new literature on climate mitigation
including
implications for
global sustainable development.
In this
Sixth Assessment Cycle
the
IPCC has
also
published three
Special Reports
1
all of which emphasise the rising threat of
climate change and the
implications
for
more ambitious mitigation efforts at all scales.
At the same time, the Paris Agreement
(PA)
and the
UN
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
,
both
adopted in 2015, set out a globally agreed agenda within which climate mitigation efforts must be
located. Along with a better understanding of the physical science basis of climate change (AR6 WGI),
and vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation (AR6
WGII), the landscape of climate mitigation has
evolved substantially since
Fifth Assessment Report (
AR5)
.
Since
AR5
,
(IPCC 2014a)
climate mitigation policies around the world have grown in both number
and shape
(Chapter 13).
However, while the average
rate of
annual
increase of CO
2
emissions
has
declined
(
S
ection 1.3
.2
)
GHG emissions globally continued to rise, underlining the urgency of the
mitigation challenge (Chapters 2, 3)
.
Over twenty
countries have cut absolute emissions alongside
sustained economic growth
,
but
the
scale
of
mitigation action across countries remain
s
varied and
generally much slower than the pace required
to meet
the
goals of
the Paris
Agreement
(
S
ection 1.3.2
in this chapter and
S
ection
2.7.2
in Chapter 2
)
.
Per
-
capita GHG emissions between count
ries even at
similar stages of economic development (
based on
GDP per capita) vary by a factor of three (
Figure
1.6
)
and by more than two on consumption basis (
S
ection
2.
3
in Chapter 2
).
The Special Report on 1.5
o
C underlined that humanity is now living with the “unifying lens of the
Anthropocene”
(SR 1.5 IPCC
2018a, 52 & 53)
,
that requires a sharpened focus on the impact of human
activity on the climate system and the planet more broadly
given ‘planetary boundaries’
(Steffen et
al.
2015)
including interdependencies of climate change and biodiversity
(Dasgupta 2021)
. Recent
literature assessed by WGs I and II of this AR6
underlines the urgency of
climate action
as
c
umulative
CO
2
emissions, along with other greenhouses gases, drives the temperature change
.
Across AR6, global
temp
erature changes are defined relative to the period 1850
-
1900, as in SR1.5 and collaboration with
WGI enabled the use of AR6
-
calibrated emulators to assure consistency across the three Working
Groups.
T
he remaining
‘
carbon budgets
’
(see
Annex I
)
as
sociated with 1.5°C and 2°C temperature
targets equate to about
one
(
for
1.5°C) to
three
(
for
2°C) decades of current emissions, as from 2020
,
but with significant variation depending on multiple factors including other gases
