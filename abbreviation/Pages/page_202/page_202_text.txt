. The feasibility dimensions shown are:
geophysical, technological, economic,
socio
-
cultural and
institutional
.
T
he thresholds shown are:
i)
plausible
–
range of values based on past historical trends or other
peer reviewed assessments;
ii)
best case scenario
–
range of values assuming major political support or
technological breakthrough
;
iii)
unprecedented
–
values going
beyond
those
observed or reported in peer
reviewed assessments.
Overlayed are the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways
consistent with SSP2
(L

C1 category; Neg, GS: C3 category)
.
The posi
tioning of the illustrative pathways is simply indicative of the
general trade
