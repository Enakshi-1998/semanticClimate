h
e majority of
the
assessed scenarios are
consistent with SSP2.
Using the SSPs permit
s
a more systematic assessment of future GHG emissions
and their uncertainties than was possible in AR5. The main emissions drivers across the SSPs include
growth in popula

reaching 8.5

9.7 billion by 2050, and an increase in global GDP of 2.7
-
4.1% per
year between 2015 and 2050. Final energy demand in the absence of any new climate policies is
projected to grow to around 480 to 750 EJ yr
