green infrastructure can deliver significant p
ublic health benefits and lower GHG emissions. {8.2, 8.3.4,
8.4, 8.6}
Urban green and blue infrastructure can mitigate climate change through carbon
sinks
, avoided
emissions, and reduced energy use while offering multiple co
-
benefits
(
high confidence
).
Urb
an
green and blue infrastructure, including urban forests and street trees, permeable surfaces, and green
roofs offer potentials to mitigate climate change directly through storing carbon, and indirectly by
inducing a cooling effect that reduces energy dem
and and reducing energy use for water treatment.
Global
ly,
urban trees store approximately 7.4 billion tonnes of carbon, and sequester approximately 217
million tonnes of carbon annually, although carbon storage
is
highly dependent on biome. Among the
multiple co
-
benefits of green and blue infrastructure are reducing the urban heat island (UHI) effect and
heat stress, reducing stormwater runoff, improving air quality, and improving
the
mental and physical
health of u
rban dwellers.
Many of these options also provide benefits to
climate
adaptation
.
{8.2, 8.4.4}
The potentials and sequencing of mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions will vary
depending on a cityâ€™s land use and spatial form and its state of urbani
s
ation, whether it is an
established city with existing infrastructure, a rapidly growing city with new infrastructure, or
an emerging city with infrastructure
build
-
up
(medium confidence)
.
The long lifespan of urban
infrastructures locks in behaviour and e
missions. Urban infrastructures and urban form can enable
socio
-
cultural and lifestyle changes that can significantly reduce carbon footprints. Rapidly growing
cities can avoid higher future emissions through urban planning to co
-
locate jobs and housing to
achieve
compact urban form, and by leapfrogging to low
-
carbon technologies. Established cities will achieve
the largest GHG emissions savings by replacing, repurposing, or retrofitting the building stock, strategic
infilling and densifying, as well as thr
ough modal shift and the electrification of the urban energy
system. New and emerging cities have unparalleled potential to
significantly reduce
GHG emissions
while achieving high quality of life by creating compact, co
-
located, and walkable urban areas wi
th
mixed land use and transit
-
oriented design, that also preserve existing green and blue assets
.
{8.2, 8.4,
8.6}
With over 880 million people living in informal settlements, t
here are opportunities to harness
and enable informal practices and institutions
in cities related to housing, waste, energy, water,
and sanitation to reduce resource use and mitigate climate change
(low evidence, medium
agreement).
The upgrading of informal settlements and inadequate housing to improve resilience and
well
-
being offer
s a chance to create a low
-
carbon transition.
However, there is limited quantifiable data
on these practices and their cumulative impacts on GHG emissions. {8.1.4, 8.2.2,

Achieving
transformational changes in cities for climate change mitigation and adaptation will
require engaging multiple scales of governance, including governments and non
-
state actors, and
in connection with substanti
al
financing beyond sectoral
approaches
(very h
igh confidence).
Large
and complex infrastructure projects for urban mitigation
are often beyond the capacity of local
municipality budgets, jurisdictions, and institutions. Partnerships between cities and international
institutions, national and region go
vernments, transnational networks, and local stakeholders
play a
pivotal role in mobilizing global climate finance resources for a range of infrastructure projects with
low
-
carbon emissions and related spatial planning programs across key sectors. {8.4, 8.
