Panel d shows population, GDP per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for percentage GHG

emissions released to the atmosphere in order to generate the goods and services consumed by a certain entity
(e.g., region). Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included.

The unit costs of several low-emission technologies have fallen continuously since 2010.
Innovation policy packages have enabled these cost reductions and supported global adoption.
Both tailored policies and comprehensive policies addressing innovation systems have helped
overcome the distributional, environmental and social impacts potentially associated with global
diffusion of low-emission technologies. Innovation has lagged in developing countries due to
weaker enabling conditions. Digitalisation can enable emission reductions, but can have adverse
side-effects unless appropriately governed.

From 2010–2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy (85%),
wind energy (55%), and lithium-ion batteries (85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10x
for solar and >100x for electric vehicles (EVs), varying widely across regions (Figure SPM.3). The mix
of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption includes public R&D, funding for
demonstration and pilot projects, and demand pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain
scale. In comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical record shows that multiple
large-scale mitigation technologies, with fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost
reductions and their adoption has grown slowly. (

B.4.2
Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological characteristics have been
effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. Appropriately designed
policies and governance have helped address distributional impacts and rebound effects. Innovation has
provided opportunities to lower emissions and reduce emission growth and created social and
environmental co-benefits. (
