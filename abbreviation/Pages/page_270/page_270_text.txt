FAQ
1.2
Which
Greenhouse
Gasses
(GHGs)
are
relevant
to
which
sectors?
Anthropogenic
GHGs
such
as
carbon
dioxide
(CO
2
),
methane
(CH
4
),
nitrous
oxide
(N
2
O),
and
fluorinated
gases
(e.g.
hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons,
Sulphur
hexafluoride)
are
released
from
various
sources.
CO
2
makes
the
largest
contribution
to
global
GHG
emissions;
but
some
have
extremely
long
atmospheric
lifetimes
extending
to
tens
of
thousands
of
years,
such
as
F
gases
(Chapter
2).
Different
combinations
of
gases
are
emitted
from
different
activit
ies
.
The
largest
source
of
CO
2
is
combustion
of
fossil
fuels
in
energy
conversion
systems
like
boilers
in
electric
power
plants,
engines
in
aircraft
and
automobiles,
an
d
in
cooking
and
heating
within
homes
and
businesses
(approximately
64%
of
emissions,
Figure
SPM.2)
.
Fossil
fuels
are
also
a
major
source
of
methane
(
CH
4
)
,
the
second
biggest
contributor
to
global
warming.
While
most
GHGs
come
from
fossil
fuel
combustion,
about
one
quarter
come
s
from
land
-
related
activities
like
agriculture
(mainly
CH
4
and
N
2
O)
and
deforestation
(mainly
CO
2
),
with
additional
emissions
from
industrial
processes
(mainly
CO
2
,
N
2
O
and
F
-
gases)
,
and
municipal
waste
and
wastewater
(mainly
CH
4
)
(2).
In
addition
to
these
emissions,
black
carbon
–
an
aerosol
that
is,
for
example
,
emitted
during
incomplete
combustion
of
fossil
fuels
–
contributes
to
warming
of
the
Earth’s
atmosphere
,
w
h
ilst
some
other
short
-
lived
pollutants
temporarily
cool
the
surface
(

6.5.4.3
)

FAQ
1.3
What
is
the
difference
between
“
net
zero
emissions
”
and
“carbon
neutrality”
?
Annex
I
states
that
“carbon
neutrality
and
net
zero
CO2
emissions
are
overlapping
concepts”
which
“can
be
applied
at
the
global
or
sub
-
global
scales
(e.g.,
regional,
national
and
sub
-
national)”.
At
the
global
scale
the
terms
are
equivalent.
At
sub
-
global
scales,
net
-
zer
o
CO2
typically
applies
to
emissions
under
direct
control
or
territorial
responsibility
of
the
entity
reporting
them
(e.g.
a
country,
district
or
sector);
while
carbon
neutrality
is
also
applied
to
firms,
commodities
and
activities
(e.g.
a
service
or
an
event)
and
generally
includes
emissions
and
removals
beyond
the
entity’s
direct
control
or
territorial
responsibility,
termed
‘Scope
3’
or
‘value
chain
emissions’
(Bhatia
et
al.
2011)
.
This
means
the
emissions
and
removals
that
should
be
included
are
wider
for
‘neutrality’
than
for
net
-
zero
goals,
but
also
that
offset
mechanisms
could
be
employed
to
help
achieve
neutrality
through
abatement
beyond
what
is
possible
under
the
direct
control
of
the
entity.
Rules
and
environment
al
integrity
criteria
are
intended
to
ensure
additionality
and
avoid
double
counting
of
offsets
consistent
with
“neutrality”
claims
(see
Annex
I
definitions
of
“Carbon
neutrality”
and
“Offset”
for
detail
and
a
list
of
criteria).
While
the
term
‘carbon’
neutrality
in
this
report
is
defined
as
referring
specifically
to
CO
2
neutrality,
use
of
this
term
in
practice
can
be
ambiguous,
as
some
users
apply
it
to
neutrality
of
all
GHG
emissions.
GHG
neutrality
means
an
entity’s
gross
emissions
of
all
GHG
must
be
balanced
by
the
removal
of
an
equivalent
amount
of
CO2
from
the
atmos
phere.
This
requires
the
selection
of
a
suitable
metric
that
aggregates
emissions
from
non
-
CO2
gases,
such
as
the
commonly
used
GWP100
metric
(for
a
discussion
of
GHG
metrics,
see
AR6
WG1
Box
1.3
and
Cross
-
Chapter
Box
2
in
Chapter
2
of
this
report).
