no or limited overshoot assume immediate action as defined here (Category C1 in Table SPM.1).
FOOTNOTE 28:
In this report, “unconditional” elements of NDCs refer to mitigation efforts put
forward without any conditions. “Conditional” elements refer to mitigation efforts that are contingent
on international cooperation, for example bilateral and multilateral agreements, financing or monetary
and/or technological transfers. This terminology is used in the literature and the UNFCCC’s NDC
Synthesis Reports, not by the Paris Agreement. {4.2.1, 14.3.2}

: Two types of gaps are assessed: The implementation gap is calculated as the
difference between the median of global emissions in 2030 implied by policies implemented by the end
of 2020 and those implied by NDCs announced prior to COP26. The emissions gap is calculated as the
difference between GHG emissions implied by the NDCs (minimum/maximum emissions in 2030) and
the median of global GHG emissions in modelled pathways limiting warming to specific levels based
on immediate action and with stated likelihoods as indicated (Table SPM.1).
B.6.2
Global emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to
COP26 are lower than the emissions implied by the original NDCs
[FOOTNOTE 30] (
high confidence
).
The original emission gap has fallen by about 20% to one third relative to pathways that limit warming
to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action (Category C3a in Table SPM.1), and by about 15-20% relative
to pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Category C1 in Table
SPM.1) (
medium confidence
). (Figure SPM.4) {3.5, 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4}
FOOTNOTE 30:
Original NDCs refer to those submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015 and 2016.
Unconditional elements of NDCs announced prior to COP26 imply global GHG emissions in 2030 that
are 3.8 [3.0–5.3] GtCO

lower than those from the original NDCs, and 4.5 [2.7–6.3] GtCO

lower when conditional elements of NDCs are included. NDC updates at or after COP26 could
further change the implied emissions.
B.6.3
Modelled global emission pathways consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 that limit
warming to 2°C (>67%) (Category C3b in Table SPM.1) imply annual average global GHG emissions
reduction rates of 0–0.7 GtCO
2
-eq per year during the decade 2020-2030, with an unprecedented
acceleration to 1.4–2.0 GtCO
2
-eq per year during 2030-2050 (
medium confidence
). Continued
investments in unabated high emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low
emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks
(
high confidence
). {3.3, 3.5, 3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4}
B.6.4
Modelled global emission pathways consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 will
likely
exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century. Those pathways that then return warming to 1.5°C by 2100
with a likelihood of 50% or greater imply a temperature overshoot of 0.15-0.3°C (42 pathways in
category C2 in Table SPM.1). In such pathways, global cumulative net-negative CO
2
emissions are -
380 [-860 to -200] GtCO

[FOOTNOTE 31] in the second half of the century, and there is a rapid
acceleration of other mitigation efforts across all sectors after 2030. Such overshoot pathways imply
increased climate-related risk, and are subject to increased feasibility concerns[FOOTNOTE 32], and
greater social and environmental risks, compared to pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with
no or limited overshoot. (
