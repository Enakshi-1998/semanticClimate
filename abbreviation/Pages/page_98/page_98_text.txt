Policies can
shift
development pathways.
The
re
are
examples of policies
implemented in the
pursuit of overall societal development objectives, such as job crea
tion, macro
-
economic stability,
economic growth, and public health and welfare.
In some countries, such policies are framed as part
of a
just transition
(
Box TS.3
), however, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and
hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options
(medium
confidence
)
{4.3.3}. Coordinated
policy mixes would need to
orchestrate
multiple actors
–
individuals, groups and collect
ives, corporate
actors, institutions and infrastructure actors
–
to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards
sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways
can jointly support mitigation and
adaptation {4.4.2}.
Some studies explore the risks of high complexity
and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways
.

{4.4.3
}
A
n increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050 (mid
-
term)
have been developed by
various actors
. A growing number of such strategies aim at net
zero GHG or CO
2
emissions, but
it is not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of sample (
medium
evidence; low agreement
) {4.2.4}.
Non
-
state actors are also engaging in a wide range of mitigation
initiatives. When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub
-
national and non
-
state international
cooperative initiatives could reduce
emissions by
up to about 20 GtCO
2
-
eq in 2030 (
limited
evidence,
medium agreement
) {4.2.3}. Yet perceived or real conflicts between mitigation and other SDGs can
impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have
significant implications for development objectives and
macroeconomic costs at country level. The
