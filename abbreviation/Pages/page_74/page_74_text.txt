Current NDCs refer to nationally determined contributions submitted to the UNFCCC, as well as publicly announced but not yet
submitted mitigation pledges
with sufficient detail on tar

included. Intended
nationally determined contributions (INDCs) were converted to NDCs as countries ratified the Paris Agreement. O
