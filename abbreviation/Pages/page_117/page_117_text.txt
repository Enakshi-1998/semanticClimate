new urban infrastructures adapted to

{Chapter
8; Box 10.1}.
Many countries, businesses, and individuals stand to lose wealth from stranded assets. Countries,
businesses, and individuals may therefore desire to keep assets in operation even if financial, social, or
environmental concerns call for retirement. This creates political economic risks, including actions by
asset owners to hinder climate policy reform
{6.7; Box 6.11
}
. It will be easier to retire these assets
if
the
risks are communicated, if sustainability reporting is mandated and enforced, and if
corporations
are protected
with arrangements that shield them from short

term shareholder value
maximi
s
ation.
Without early retirements, or reductions in utilisation, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more
GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C {2.7}. Including the pipeline of planned
investments would push these future emissions
into the uncertainty range of 2°C carbon budgets {2.7}.
Continuing to build new coal
-
fired power plants and other fossil infrastructure will increase future
transition costs and may jeopardize efforts to
lik
el
y
limit warming to 2
°
C
or 1.5
°
C
with no or limi
ted
overshoot
.
One study has estimated that USD11.8 trillion in current assets will need to be stranded by
2050 for 2°C world; further delaying action for another 10 years would result in an additional USD7.7
trillion in stranded assets by 2050
.
{15.5.2}
Experience from past stranding
indicates
that compensation for the devaluation costs of private sector
stakeholders by the public sector is common
.
Limiting new investments in fossil technologies hence
also reduces public finance risks in the long term

A low
-
carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic
opportunities
(
high confidence
)
.
Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the
next decades, if
it
is
to be
likely
that warming is
limited to 2°C
,
or
if warming is limited to
1.5
°C
with
no or limited overshoot
. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the reallocations of
investment flows that are
anticipated
across sub
-
sectors, namely from fossil fue
ls (extraction,
conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, nuclear power, CCS,
electricity networks and storage, and end
-
use energy efficiency. A significant and growing share of
investments between now and 2050 will be made
in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. {6.7}
Climate change will affect many future local and national low
-
carbon energy systems. The
impacts, however, are uncertain, particularly at the regional scale
(
high confidence
)
.
Climate
change will alter h
ydropower production, bioenergy and agricultural yields, thermal power plant
efficiencies, and demands for heating and cooling, and it will directly impact power system
infrastructure. Climate change will not affect wind and solar resources to the extent t
hat it would
compromise their ability to reduce emissions. {6.5}
Electricity systems powered predominantly by renewables will be increasingly viable over the
coming decades, but it will be challenging to supply the entire energy system with renewable
energ
y
(
high confidence
)
.
Large shares of variable solar PV and wind power can be incorporated in
electricity grids through batteries, hydrogen, and other forms of storage; transmission; flexible non
-
renewable generation; advanced controls; and greater demand
-
s
ide responses. Because some
applications (e.g.,
aviation
) are not currently amenable to electrification,
it is anticipated that
100%
renewable energy systems
will
need to include alternative fuels such as hydrogen or biofuels. Economic,
regulatory, social,
and operational challenges increase with higher shares of renewable electricity and
energy. The ability to overcome these challenges in practice is not fully understood.
