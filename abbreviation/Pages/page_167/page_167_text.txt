ehavioural interventions, including the way choices are presented to end users (an intervention
practice known as choice
architecture), work synergistically with price signals, making the

).

alternative ways of redesigning and motivating decisions, alone provide small to medium contributions
to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.
Green defaults, such as automatic
enrolment in
“green energy” provision, are highly effective. Judicious labelling, framing,
