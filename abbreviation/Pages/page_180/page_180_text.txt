of mitigation policies on indices of GHG mitigation
P
olicy attribution
examines the extent to which
GHG emission reductions
, the
proximate drivers of
emissions
, and the deployment of
technologies that reduce emissions
may be reasonably attributed to
policies implemented prior to the observed changes.
Such policies include regulatory instruments such
as energy efficiency
programmes or technical standards and codes, carbon pricing, financial support for
low
-
carbon energy technologies and efficiency, voluntary agreements, and regulation of land use
practices
.
The vast majority of literature reviewed for this report examines
the effect of particular instruments in
particular
contexts
{

}
, and
only a small number directly or plausibly infer global impacts
of policies. Policies also differ in design, scope, and stringency, may change over time as they require
amen
dments or new laws, and often partially overlap with other instruments. These factors complicate
analysis, because they give rise to the potential for double counting emissions reductions that have been
observed. These lines of evidence on the impact of po
lices include:

trends in the factors that drive emissions including reduced rates
of deforestation {7.6.2}, industrial energy efficiency {
