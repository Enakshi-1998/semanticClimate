Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
greater attention than AR5 to social, economic and environmental dimensions of mitigation actions,
and institutional, legal and financial aspects {
5,
13, 14, 15}.
The report
draw
s
from literature
on
b
road and diverse analytic
frameworks
across
multiple disciplines.
These include
, inter alia
: economic and environmental efficiency
{1}
; ethics and equity {4,
5
, 17
};
innovation and the dynamics of socio
-
technical transitions {16}; and
,
socio
-
political
-
institutional
frameworks {1
,
5,
13, 14
, 17
}. These help to identify synergies and trade
-
offs with sustainable
development goals, challenges and windows of opportunity for action including co
-
benefits
,
and
equitable transitions at local, national and global scales.

This Technical Summary
(TS)
of the
WG III contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report
broadly follows the
report
chapter
order
and is structured as follows.
•
TS
S
ection
2 sets out
how the global context for mitigation has changed and summarises si
gns of
progress and continuing challenges
.
•
TS
S
ection
3
evaluates
emission trends and drivers including recent sectoral, financial,
technological and policy developments.
•
TS
S
ection
4 identifies
mitigation and development pathways in the near
and medium
-
term
to
2050
,
and in the long
er
term
to 2100
. This section
include
s
an assessment of
how mitigation
pathways
deploying
different
portfolios of
mitigation
responses
are
consistent with limiting global
warming to different levels.
•
TS
S
ection
5
summarises
recent advances in
knowledge
across sectors and systems
including
energy, urban and other settlements, transport, buildings, industry
,
and
a
griculture
, forestry and
other land use
.
•
TS
S
ection
6 examines
how
enabling conditions
including
behaviour and lifestyle
, policy,
governance and
institutional
capacity
,
international cooperation, finance
,
and
innovation
and
technology
can accelerate
mitigation
in the context of sustainable development
•

evaluat
es
how mitigation c
an be achieved in the context of sustainable
development,
while
maximising co

benefits and minimising risks

FOOTNOTE
2
Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of
the
underlying evidence
, typeset in italics
. The validity
of a f
inding is evaluated in terms of the
evidence
quality
–
‘limited’, ‘medium’, ‘robust’
–
and the degree of
agreement
between sources
–
‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’
. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers:
very low, low, medium, high and very hig
h
.
Generally, the level of confidence is highest where there is
robust
evidence from multiple sources
and
high agreement
.
For findings with, for example,
‘
robust evidence, medium
agreement
’
, a confidence statement may not always be appropriate.
The assessed likelihood of an outcome or a
result is described as:
virtually certain
99
–
100% probability,
very likely
90
–
100%,

66
–

about as likely
