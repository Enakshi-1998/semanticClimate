Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary
depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints.
[FOOTNOTE 54] In modelled
pathways that report CDR and that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global
cumulative CDR during 2020-2100 from Bioenergy with Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage
(BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (DACCS) is 30-780 GtCO
2
and 0-310
GtCO
2
, respectively. In these modelled pathways, the AFOLU sector contributes 20-400 GtCO
2
net
negative emissions. Total cumulative net negative CO
2
emissions including CDR deployment across all
options represented in these modelled pathways are 20–660 GtCO
2
. In modelled pathways that limit
warming to 2°C (>67%), global cumulative CDR during 2020–2100 from BECCS and DACCS is 170–
650 and 0–250 GtCO
2
respectively, the AFOLU sector contributes 10–250 GtCO
2
net negative
emissions, and total cumulative net negative CO
2
emissions are around 40 [0–290] GtCO
2
. (Table

FOOTNOTE 54:
Aggregate levels of CDR deployment are higher than total net negative CO
2
emissions given that some of the deployed CDR is used to counterbalance remaining gross emissions.
Total net negative CO
2
emissions in modelled pathways might not match the aggregated net negative
CO
2
emissions attributed to individual CDR methods. Ranges refer to the 5-95th percentile across
modelled pathways that include the specific CDR method. Cumulative levels of CDR from AFOLU
cannot be quantified precisely given that: a) some pathways assess CDR deployment relative to a
baseline; and b) different models use different reporting methodologies that in some cases combine
gross emissions and removals in AFOLU. Total CDR from AFOLU equals or exceeds the net negative
emissions mentioned.
C.3.6
All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling,
and costs. Many challenges, such as dependence on CDR, pressure on land and biodiversity (e.g.,
bioenergy) and reliance on technologies with high upfront investments (e.g., nuclear), are significantly
reduced in modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently (e.g., IMP-LD) or shift
global development towards sustainability (e.g., IMP-SP). (
