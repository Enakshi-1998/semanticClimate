nitude of
these emissions can vary widely between countries
.
These
–
together with the energy and urban systems which feed and shape end

–
define the sectoral
chapters in this AR6
WGIII
report.
Estimates of emissions associated with
production and transport of internationally traded goods were
first presented in AR5
WGIII
, which estimated the ‘embodied emission transfers’ from upper
-
middle
-
income countries to industrialised countries through trade at about 10 percent of CO
2
emissions
in each
of these groups
(IPCC 2014a
Fig TS.5)
. The literature on this and discussion on their accounting
has
grown substantially since then (

& 8
).
The atmosphere is a shared global resource and an integral part of the “global commons”
. In the
depletion/restoration of this resource, myriad actors at various scales are involved, for instance,
individuals, communities, firms and states.
Inter alia
, international cooperation to tackle ozone
depletion and acid rain offer useful examples.
AR
5 noted that greater cooperation would ensue if
policies are perceived as fair and equitable by all countries along the spectrum of economic
development
–
implying a need for equitable sharing of the effort. A key takeaway from AR5 is that
climate policy inv
olves value judgement and ethics.
(IPCC 2014a
Box TS.1
“
People and countries have
rights and owe duties towards each other. These are matters of justice, equity, or fairness. They fall
within the subject matter of moral and political philosophy, juri
sprudence, and economics

nternational cooperation and collective action on climate change alongside local, national, regional and
global policies will be crucial to solve the problem
, and this report notes cooperative approaches beyond
simple ‘global commons’ framings
(
C
hapter
s
13, 14
).
AR5
(all Working Group Reports)
also underlined that climate policy inherently involves risk and
uncertainty (in nature, economy, society and individu
als).
To help evaluate responses, t
here exists a rich
suite of analytical tools, for example, cost
-
benefit analysis, cost
-
effectiveness analysis, multi
-
criteria
analysis, expected utility theory and catastrophe and risk models
. All
have pros and cons
, and
have been
further developed
in subsequent literature and AR6 (next section).
Recent Assessments
(IPCC 2014a, 2018b)
began to consider the role of indi
vidual behavioural choices
and cultural norms in driving energy and food patterns. Notably, SR1.5 (
S
ection
4.4.3
in Chapter 4
)
outlined emerging evidence on the potential for changes in behaviour
, lifestyle
and culture to contribute
to decarbonisat
ion (and lower the cost); for the first time, AR6 devotes a whole chapter (
C
hapter 5) to
consider these and other
underlying
drivers of energy demand, food choices and social aspects.

The assessment of the Physical Science Basis (IPCC WGI AR6) documents sustained and widespread
changes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean, providing unequivocal evidence of a world
that has warmed, associated with rising atmospheric CO
2
con
centrations reaching levels not experienced
in at least the last 2 million years. Aside from temperature, other clearly discernible, human
-
induced
changes beyond natural variations include declines in Arctic
S
ea ice and glaciers, thawing of
permafrost, and
a strengthening of the global water cycle (WG1 SPM A.2, B.3 and B.4). Oceanic
changes include rising sea level, acidification, deoxygenation, and changing salinity (WG1 SPM B.3).
Over land, in recent decades, both frequency and severity have increased for
hot extremes but decreased
for cold extremes; intensification of heavy precipitation is observed in parallel with a decrease in
available water in dry seasons, along with an increased occurrence of weather conditions that promote
wildfires.
In defining th
e objective of international climate negotiations as being to ‘prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference’
(Article 2 UNFCCC 1992)
, the UNFCCC underlines the centrality of risk
framing in considering the threats of climate change and potential response measures. Against the
background of ‘unequivoca
