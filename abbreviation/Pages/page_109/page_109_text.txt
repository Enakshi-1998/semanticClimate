Panel a shows the developmen
t of global CO
2
emissions (upper sub
-
panel) and timing of
when emissions from different sources reach net zero CO
2
and GHG emissions (lower sub
-
panel). Panels b and
c show the development of global CH

and N

emissions,
respectively. Ranges of baseline em
issions pathways

C with no or limited overshoot pathways (light blue, category C1) and <scenarios
likely below 2
o
C pathways (grey, category C3) are compared to the emissions from two pathways illustrative of
high emissions (CurPol and ModAct) and five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs): IMP
-
LD (low demand),
IMP
-
Ren (renewables), IMP
-
SP (shifting pathways), IMP
-
N
eg (extensive use of
CD
R
measures in the energy
and the industry sectors to achieve
net negative emissions) and IMP
-
GS (Gradual strengthening of current
policies). The assessment of mitigation pathways explores a wide scenario space from the literature wit
hin
which seven illustrative pathways (IPs) are explored, composed of two sets: (i) one set of five Illustrative
Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) and (ii) one set of two reference pathways illustrative for of high emissions.
Panel d shows different net zero CO
2
emissions systems for the IMPs and the respective sectoral composition of
CO
2
and non
-
CO
2
emissions sources and sinks. The net zero CO
2
emissions systems are compared to the
emissions from the year 2019.
Panel e shows the contribution of different sectors
and sources to the emissions reductions for reaching net
-
zero
GHG emissions. Bars denote the median emissions reductions for all pathways reaching net zero GHG
emissions. The full mitigation contributions of the service sectors (transport, buildings, indus
try) are split into
direct as well as indirect (up
-
stream) CO
2
emissions reductions. In addition, the contributions from the AFOLU
sector and reductions from non
-
CO
2
emissions sources (green and grey bars) are displayed.
Pathways
likely
limiting warming t
o 2°C
or 1.5
°
C
and below exhibit substantial reductions in
emissions from all
sectors (
high confidence
).
1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot
entail CO
2
emissions reductions between 2019 and 2050 of
around 77% (31
-
96%) for energy demand,
around
115%
(90 to 167%)
for energy supply, and
around
148%
(94 to 387%)
for AFOLU.

In pathways
likely
limiting warming to 2
°
C, projected CO
2
emissions are reduced between 2019 and 2050 by around
49% for energy de
mand, 97% for energy supply, and 136% for AFOLU.

If warming is to be
limited
, d
elaying
or
failing
to
achieve
emissions reductions in one sector or
region
necessitate
s
compensating reductions in other sectors or
regions (
high confidence
).
Mitigation pathways show differences in the timing of decarboni
s
ation and when net zero CO
2
emissions are achieved across sectors and regions. At the time of
global net zero CO
2
emissions
,
emissions in some sectors and regions are positive while others are negative;
whether
specific
sectors
and regions are
posi
tive or negative
depends on the
availability and cost of
mitigation options
i
n those
regions
, and the policies implemente
d. In cost
-
effective mitigation pathways, the energy supply sector
typically reaches net zero CO
2
before the economy as a whole, while the demand sectors reach net zero
CO
2
later, if ever (
high confidence
).

Pathways
likely
limiting war
ming to 2°C
or 1
.
5
°
C
involve substantial reductions in fossil fuel
consumptio
n and a near elimination of coal
use
without CCS (
high confidence
).
These pathways
show an increase in low carbon energy, with 88% (69
-
97%) of primary energy coming from
low carbon
sources by 2100. {3.4}
Stringent emissions reductions at the level required for 2°C
or 1.5°C
are achieved through
the
increased electrificatio
n of buildings, transport, and industry,
consequently
all pathways entail
increased electricity
generation
(
high confidence
).
Nearly all electricity in pathways
likely
limiting
warming to 2℃ or
1.5°C
is
also
from low or no carbon technologies

with different shares

FOOTNOTE

Reductions greater than 100% in energy supply and AFOLU indicate that these sectors would
become carbon sinks.
