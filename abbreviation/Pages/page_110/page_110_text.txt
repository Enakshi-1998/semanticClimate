nuclear, biomass, non

fuels in combination with
CCS.
{3.4}
M
easures required to
likely
limit warming to 2°C or below can result in large scale transformation
of the land
surface (
hig
h confidence
).
These p
athways
are projected to reach net zero CO
2
emissions
in the AFOLU sector between
the
2020s and 207
0
.
Pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show
an increase
in
forest cover
of about 322 million ha (
-
67 to 890 million ha) in
2050
(high confidence
)
.
In these pathways t
he
c
ropland area to supply biomass for bioenergy (including
b
ioen
ergy
with
c
arbon
c
apture and
s
torage
(
BECCS
)
)
is around 199 (56
-
482) million ha in 2100. The use of bioenergy can lead to either increased
or reduced emissions, depending on the scale of deployment, conversion technology, fuel displaced,
and how
, and
where
,
the biomass is produced
(high confidence)
.
{3.4}
Pathways
likely
to
limit warming to 2°C
or 1.5
°
C
require
some amount of CDR to
compensate
for residual GHG
emissions
,
even
after substantial direct emissions reductions
are achieved
in all
sectors and
regions (
high confidence
).
CDR deployment in pathways serves multiple purposes:
accelerating the pace of emissions reductions, offsetting residual emissions, and creating the option for
net negative CO
2
emissions in case temperature reductions need to be achieved in the long term (
high
confidence
). CDR options in pathways are mostly limited to BECCS, afforestation and
d
irect
a
ir
CO
2
c
apture and
s
torage
(
DACCS
)
. CDR through some measures in AFOLU can be maintained for decades
but not
over
the very long term because these sinks will u
ltimately saturate (
high confidence
). {3.4}
Mitigation pathways show reductions in energy demand
,
relative to
reference scenarios
that
assume continuation of current policies
,
through a diverse set of demand
-
side interventions (
high
confidence
).
Bottom
-
up and non
-
IAM studies show significant potential for demand
-
side mitigation. A
stronger emphasis on demand
-
side mitigation implies less dependence on CDR and, consequently,
redu
ced pressure on land and biodiversity. {3.4, 3.7}
Limiting warming requires shifting energy investments away from fossil
-
fuels and towards low
-
carbon
technologies (
high confidence
).
The bulk of investments are needed in medium
-
and low
-
income regions. Inve
stment needs in the electricity sector are on average 2.3 trillion USD2015 yr
-
1
over
2023
-
2052 for pathways limiting temperature to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and 1.7 trillion
USD2015 yr
-
1
for pathways
likely
limiting warming to 2°C. {3.6.1}
Pathw
ays
likely
to
avoid overshoot of 2°C warming require more rapid near
-
term
transformations and are associated with higher up
-
front transition costs, but
at the same time
bring long
-
term gains for the economy as well as earlier benefits in avoided climate change
impacts
(high confidence)
.
This conclusion is independent of the discount rate applied, though the
modelled cost
-
optimal balance of mitigation action over time doe
s depend on the discount rate. Lower
discount rates favour earlier mitigation, reducing reliance on CDR and temperature overshoot. {3.6.1,
3.8}
Mitigation pathways
likely
to
limit warming to 2°C entail losses in global GDP with respect to
reference scenari
os
of between 1.3% and 2.7% in 2050
. I
n pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C
with no or limited overshoot, losses are between 2.6% and 4.2%.
T
hese estimates do not account
for the economic benefits of avoided climate change
impacts
(medium confidence)
.
In mi
tigation
pathways
likely
to
limit warming to 2°C, marginal abatement costs of carbon are about 90 (60
