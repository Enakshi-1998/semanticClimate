Collective action as part of social or lifestyle
movements underpins system change (
high
confidence
).
Collective action and social organising are crucial to shift the possibility space of public
policy on climate change
mitigation. For example, climate strikes have given voice to youth in more
than 180 countries. In other instances, mitigation policies allow the active participation of all
stakeholders, resulting in building social trust, new coalitions, legitimising chan
ge, and thus initiate a
positive cycle in climate governance capacity and policies. {

Transition pathways and changes in social norms often start with pilot experiments led by
dedicated individuals and niche groups (
high confidence
).
Co
llectively, such initiatives can find
entry points to prompt policy, infrastructure, and policy reconfigurations, supporting the further uptake
of technological and lifestyle innovations. Individuals’ agency is central as social change agents and
narrators
of meaning. These bottom
-
up socio
-
cultural forces catalyse a supportive policy environment,
which enables changes. {

The current effects of climate change, as well as some mitigation strategies, are threatening the
viability of existing business pra
ctices, while some corporate efforts also delay mitigation action
(
medium confidence
)
. Policy packages th
at
include job creation programs can help to preserve social
trust, livelihoods, respect, and dignity of all workers and employees involved. Business m
odels that
protect rent extracting behaviour may sometimes delay political action. Corporate advertisement and
brand building strategies
may also attempt to deflect corporate responsibility to individuals or aim to
appropriate climate care sentiments in th
eir own brand
–
building. {

, 5.6.4}
Middle actors
–
professionals, experts, and regulators
–
play a crucial albeit underestimated and
underutilised role in establishing low
-
carbon standards and practices (
medium confidence
).
Building managers, landlords
, energy efficiency advisers, technology installers, and car dealers
influence patterns of mobility and energy consumption by acting as middle actors or intermediaries in
the provision of building or mobility services and need greater capacity and motivati
on to play this role.

Social influencers and thought leaders can increase
the adoption of low
-
carbon technologies,
behaviours, and lifestyles
(
high confidence
)
.
Preferences are malleable and can align with a cultural
shift. The modelling of such shifts by salient and respected community members can help bring about
changes in different service provisioning systems.
Between 10% and 30% of committed individuals are
required to set new social norms. {
