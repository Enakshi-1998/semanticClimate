Figure 1
legend:
Limiting warming to a specific level can be consistent with a range of
dates when
net zero CO
2
emissions need to be achieved. This difference in the date of net zero CO
2
emissions reflects
the
different emissions profiles
that
are possible while staying within a specific carbon budget and the associated
warming limit. Shiftin
g the year of net zero to a later point in time (>2050), however, requires more rapid and
deeper near
-
term emissions reductions (in 2030 and 2040) if warming is to be limited to the same level.

Note: i
n this assessment the terms n
et zero CO
2
emissions
and
carbon neutrality
have different meanings and are
only equivalent at the global scale. At the scale of regions, or sectors, each term applies different system
boundaries.
This is also the case for the related terms
net zero GHG
and
GHG neutr
ality
