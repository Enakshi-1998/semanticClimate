Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG
III
Key mitigation options such as materials efficiency, circular material flows and emerging primary
processes, are not well represen
ted in climate change scenario modelling and integrated
assessment models, albeit with some progress in recent
years
(high confidence)
.
The character of
these interventions (e.g., appearing in many forms across complex value chains, making cost estimates
d
ifficult) combined with the limited data on new fossil free primary processes help explain why they
are less represented in models than, for example, CCS. As a result, overall mitigation costs and the need
for CCS may be overestimated. {11.4.2.1}
Electrification is emerging as a key mitigation option for
industry
(high confidence)
.
Using
electricity directly, or indirectly via hydrogen from electrolysis for high temperature and chemical
feedstock requirements, offers many options to reduce emission
s. It also can provide substantial grid
balancing services, for example through electrolysis and storage of hydrogen for chemical process use
or demand response.

Carbon is a key building block in organic chemicals, fuels and materials a
nd will remain
important
(high confidence)
.
In order to reach net zero CO
2
emissions for the carbon needed in society
(e.g., plastics, wood, aviation fuels, solvents, etc.), it is important to close the use loops for carbon and
carbon dioxide through incre
ased circularity with mechanical and chemical recycling, more efficient
use of biomass feedstock with addition of low GHG hydrogen to increase product yields (e.g., for
biomethane and methanol), and potentially direct air capture of CO
2
as a new carbon sou
rce. {11.3,
11.4.1}
Production costs for very low to zero emissions basic materials may be high but the cost for final
consumers and the general economy will be
low
(medium confidence)
.
Costs and emissions
reductions potential in industry, and especially
heavy industry, are highly contingent on innovation,
commerciali
s
ation, and market uptake polic
ies
. Technologies exist to take all industry sectors to very
low or zero emissions, but require 5
–
15 years of intensive innovation, commerciali
s
ation, and policy
to
ensure uptake. Mitigation costs are in the rough range of USD50

, with wide variation
within and outside this band. This affects competitiveness and requires supporting policy. Although
production
cost increases can be significant, they translate to very small increases in the costs for final
products, typically less t
han a few percent depending on product, assumptions, and system boundaries.

S
everal technological options
exist
for very low to zero emissions steel, but their uptake will
require inte
grated material efficiency, recycling, and pr
oduction decarbonisation policies
(high
confidence)
.
Material efficiency can potentially reduce steel demand by up to 40% based on design for
less steel use, long life, reuse, constructability, and low contamination recycling. Secondary production
through
high quality recycling must be maximi
s
ed. Production decarbonisation will also be required,
starting with the retrofitting of existing facilities for partial fuel switching (e.g., to biomass or hydrogen),
CCU and CCS, followed by very low and zero emission

options
can
significantly
reduce cement and concrete emissions.
Producer, use
r, and regulator education, as well as innovation and commerciali
s
ation policy are
needed
(medium confidence)
.
Cement and concrete are currently overused because they are
inexpensive, durable, and ubiquitous, and consumption decisions typically do not give
weight to their
production emissions. Basic material efficiency efforts to use only well

only where needed (e.g., using right

. Cementitious material substitution with various materials (e.g.,
ground limestone and calcined clays) can reduce process calcination emissions by up to 50% and
occasionally much more. Until a very low GHG emissions alternative binder to Portland cement i
