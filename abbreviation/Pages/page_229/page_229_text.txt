.
The magnitude of carbon leakage
(
Annex I
)
caused by unilateral mitigation in a fragmented climate policy
world depends on trade and substitution patterns of fossil fuels and the design of policies
(see Box 5.4.
AR5)
, but its potential significance
in trade
-
exposed energy
-
intensive sectors
(Naegele and Zaklan 2
019;
Carbone and Rivers 2017; Bauer et al. 2013)
can make it an important constraint on policy.

Akimoto
et al.
(2018)
argue that differences in marginal
abatement cost of NDCs could cause carbon leakage in energy
-
intensive, trade
-
exposed sectors, and could
weaken effective global mitigation.
P
oli
cy responses to cope with carbon leakage includ
e
border carbon adjustment (BCAs) and differentiated
carbon tax
es
(Liu et al. 2020)
.
Some BCA options focusing on levelling the cost of carbon paid by
consumers on products could be designed in line with WTO
(Ismer et al. 2016)
while others
may not be
(Mehling et al. 2019)
.
All proposals could involve difficulty of tracing and verifying the carbon content of
inputs
(Onder 2012; Denis
-
Ryan et al. 2016).
An international consensus and certification practice on the
carbon content would help to overcome WTO compatibility
(Holzer 2014)
.

Official inventories report territorial emissions
, which
do not consider the impacts embodied in import
s of
goods
.
Global supply chains undo
ubtedly lead to
a growth in trade volumes
(Federico and Tena

,
alternative
methods have been suggested
to
account for emissions
associated with international trade
,
such as shared responsib
ility
(Lenzen et al. 2007)
, technology adjusted consumption based accounting
(Kander et al. 2015)
, value added

based responsibility
(Pi√±ero et al. 2019)
and exergy
-
based responsibility
based on thermodyn
amics
(Khajehpour et al. 2019)
. Consumption
-
based emissions (i.e. attribution of
emissions related to domestic consumption and imports
to
final destination)
are not officially reported in
global emissions datasets
but data has improved
(Afionis et al. 2017; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013)
.
This
analysis
have been used extensively for consumption

based accounting of emissions
, and other
environmental impacts

,
and between developing countries

.This trend is shifting, with a growth in trade between non

OECD countries
(Meng et
al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019)
, and a decline in emissions intensity of traded goods
(Wood et al. 2020b)
.
The
P
aris Agreeme
nt
primarily deals with national commitments relating to domestic emissions and
removals,
hence
emissions from international aviation and shipping are not covered
.
A
viation
and shipping
accounted
for approximately 2.
7
% of
greenhouse gas emissions
in 2019 (
before COVID

19);
see Chapter

for discussion
.
In addition to
CO

emissions,
aircraft
-
produced contrail cirrus clouds and
emissions
of
black carbon and short

lived aerosols (e.g. sulphates)
from
shipping
are
especially harmful for the Arctic

Technology
The rapid developments in technology over the past decade enhance potential for transformative changes,
in particular to help deliver climate goals simultaneously with other SDGs.
