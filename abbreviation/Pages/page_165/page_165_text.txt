{5.2.2.1, 5.2.2.2, Box 5.3}
Alternative service provision systems, for example those enabled through digitalisation, sharing
economy initiatives and circular
economy initiatives, have to date made a limited contribution to
climate change mitigation (
medium confidence)
.
While digitali
sation through specific new products
and applications holds potential for improvement in service
-
level efficiencies, without public policies
and regulations, it also has the potential to increase consumption and energy use. Reducing the energy
use of data
centres, networks, and connected devices is possible in managing low
-
carbon digitalisation.
Claims on the benefits of the circular economy for
sustainability and climate change mitigation have
limited evidence.

: Circular Economy (CE)
In AR6, the C
ircular Economy (CE)
concept {Annex
I
} is highlighted as an increasingly important
mitigation
approach
that can
help
deliver human well
-
being by minimi
s
ing waste of energy and
resources. While definitions of CE vary, its essence is to shift away from linear “make and dispose”
economic models to those that emphasize product longevity, reuse, refurbishment, recycling, an
d
material efficiency, thereby enabling more circular material systems that reduce embodied energy and
emissions
.

Whereas IPCC AR4 {WG
III, Ch
apter
10} included a separate chapter on waste sector emissions and
waste manageme
nt practices, and AR5 {WG
III, Ch
apter
10} reviewed the importance of “reduce,
reuse, recycle” and related policies, AR6
focuses on how
CE can reduce waste in materials production
and consumption by optimi
s
ing materials’ end
-
use service utility. Specific e
xamples of CE
implementations, policies, and mitigation potentials are included in chapters
5, 8, 9, 11 and 12
.

CE is shown to empower new social actors in mitigation actions, given that it relies on the synergistic
actions of p
roducers, sellers, and consumers {11.3.3}. As an energy and resource demand
-
reduction
strategy, it is consistent with high levels of human well
-
being
{5.3.4.3} and ensure
s
better
environmental quality
(

{5.2.1}. It also creates jobs
through increased sharing, reuse,
refurbishment, and recycling activities. Therefore, CE contributes to several SDGs, including Clean
Water and Sanitation (SDG6), Affordable Energy and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and
Economic Growth (SDG8), Responsibl
e Production and Consumption (SDG12) and Climate Action
(SDG13)
.
{11.5.3.2}
Emissions savings derive from reduced primary material production and transport. For example, in
buildings, lifetime extension, material efficiency, and reusable
components reduce embodied emissions
by avoiding demand for structural materials {9.3, 9.5}. At regional scales, urban/industrial symbiosis
reduce primary material demand through byproduct exchange networks {11.3.3}. CE strategies also
exhibit enabling eff
ects, such as material
-
efficient and circular vehicle designs that also improve fuel
economy {10.2.2.2}. There is growing interest in “circular bioeconomy” concepts applied to bio
