Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
The global share of future urban GHG emissions is expected to increase through 2050 with
moderate to no mitigation efforts due to growth trends in population, urban land expansion and
infrastructure and service demands, but the ext
ent of the increase depends on the scenario and
the scale and timing of urban mitigation action
(
medium confidence
).
With aggressive and
immediate mitigation policies to limit global warming
to
1.5°C by the end of the century, including
high levels of electrification, energy and material efficiency, renewable energy preferences, and socio
-
behavioural responses, urban GH
G emissions could approach net zero and reach a maximum of 3
GtCO
2
-
eq in 2050. Under a scenario with aggressive but not immediate urban mitigation policies to
limit global warming to 2°C, urban emissions could reach 17 GtCO
2
-
eq in 2050. With no urban
mitig
ation efforts, urban emissions could more than double from 2020 levels and
reach 65 GtCO
2
-
eq in
2050, while being limited to 34 GtCO
2
-
eq in 2050 with only moderate mitigation efforts.
