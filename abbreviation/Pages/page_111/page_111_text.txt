R
eference
scenarios have a broad range depending on socioeconomic assumptions and model
characteristics
.
{3.2.1,
3.6.1}
The global benefits of pathways
likely
to
limit warming to 2°C outweigh global mitigation costs
over the 21
st
century, if aggregated economic impacts of climate change are at the moderate to
high end of the assessed range, and a weight consistent with economic theory is given to economic
impacts over the long
-
term. This holds true even without accounting for bene
fits in other
sustainable development dimensions or non
-
market damages from climate change
(
medium
confidence
). The
aggregate global economic repercussions of mitigation pathways include
:
the
macroeconomic impacts of investments in low
-
carbon solutions and
structural changes away from
emitting activities
;
co
-
benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation
;
avoided climate change impacts
;
and
,
reduced adaptation costs. Existing quantifications of
the
global aggregate economic impacts show
a strong dependence
on socioeconomic development conditions, as these shape exposure and
vulnerability and adaptation opportunities and responses. Avoided impacts for poorer households and
poorer countries represent a smaller share in aggregate economic quantifications expre
ssed in GDP or
monetary terms, whereas their well
-
being and welfare effects are comparatively larger. When aggregate
economic benefits from avoided climate change impacts are accounted for, mitigation is a welfare
-
enhancing strategy
(high confidence)
.
{3.6
.2}
The economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation
action can be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger
(medium confidence)
.
{
3.6.3}
Differences
in
aggregate employment
between
mitigation pathways
and
reference scenarios are
relatively small, although there may be substantial reallocations across sectors, with job creation
in some sectors and job losses in others
(
medium confidence
)
.
The net employmen
t effect (and
whether
employment increases or decreases
) depends on
the
scenario assumptions, modelling
framework, and modelled policy design. Mitigation has implications for employment through multiple
channels, each of which impacts geographies, sectors
and skill
-
categories differently. {3.6.4}
The economic repercussions of mitigation vary widely across regions and households, depending
on policy design and
the
level of international
cooperation
(high confidence)
.
Delayed global
cooperation increases poli
cy costs across regions, especially in those that are relatively carbon intensive
at present (
high confidence
). Pathways with uniform carbon values show higher mitigation costs in
more carbon
-
intensive regions, in fossil
-
fuels exporting regions
,
and in poorer regions (
high
confidence
). Aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms undervalue the economic
effects on households in poorer countries; the actual effects on welfare and well
-
being are
comparatively larger (
high confidence
). Mitigation at the speed and scale required to
likely
limit
warming to 2°C or below implies deep economic and structural changes, thereby raising multiple types
of distributional concerns across regions, income classes
,
and sectors (
high confidence
).
