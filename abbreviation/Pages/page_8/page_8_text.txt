The global share of emissions that can be attributed to urban areas is increasing. In 2015, urban
emissions were estimated to be 25 GtCO

The drivers of urban GHG emission are complex and include
population size, income, state of urbanisation and urban form. (

FOOTNOTE 15:
This estimate is based on consumption-based accounting, including both direct
emissions from within urban areas, and indirect emissions from outside urban areas related to the
production of electricity, goods and services consumed in cities. These estimates include all CO

emission categories except for aviation and marine bunker fuels, land-use change, forestry and
agriculture. {8.1, Annex I: Glossary}

Global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr

between 2010
and 2019. Carbon intensity (CO
2
from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO
2
FFI) per
unit primary energy) decreased by 0.3% yr
-1
, with large regional variations, over the same period mainly
due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of
renewables. This reversed the trend observed for 2000–2009. For comparison, the carbon intensity of
primary energy is projected to decrease globally by about 3.5% yr
-1
between 2020 and 2050 in modelled
scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), and by about 7.7% yr
-1
globally in scenarios that limit
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot.

B.3 Regional contributions [FOOTNOTE 17] to global GHG emissions continue to differ
widely. Variations in regional, and national per capita emissions partly reflect different
development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. The 10% of households
with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global
household GHG emissions. At least 18 countries have sustained GHG emission reductions for
longer than 10 years. (

GHG emissions trends over 1990-2019 vary widely across regions and over time, and across
different stages of development as shown in Figure SPM.2. Average global per capita net anthropogenic
GHG emissions increased from 7.7 to 7.8 tCO

-eq, ranging from 2.6 tCO
2
-eq to 19 tCO

-eq across
regions. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have much
lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO

-eq, 4.6 tCO
2
