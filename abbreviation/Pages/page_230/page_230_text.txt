AR6 WGIII
The fall i
n renewable energy costs
alongside rapid growth in capacity
(
Figure 1.3
; Figure X in Chapter 2
)
has been accompanied by varied progress in many other technology areas such
electric vehicles,
fuel cells
for both stationary and mobile applications
(
Dodds 2019)
, thermal energy (chapter 6)
and battery and other
storage technologies
(Chapters 6, 9, 1
2; Freeman et al. 2017)
.
N
uclear contributions may be enhanced by
new generations of reactors
,
e.g.
, Generation III, and small modular reactors
(Knapp and Pevec 2018; see
also
Chapter 6)

how it is produced, and deploying H

Deployment and development of CCS technologies

)
have been
much slower than projected in previous Assessments
(Page et al. 2019; IEA 2019b; see also Chapter 11)
.
Potential constraints on new energy technologies may include their material requirement
s, notably
rare
earth materials for electronics or lithium for batteries
(Wanger 2011; Flexer et al. 2018)
, stressing the
importance of recycling
(Rosendahl and Rubiano 2019; IPCC 2011b)
. Innovation is enabling greater
recycling and re

use of energy

intensive materials
(Shemi et al. 2018)
and introducing radically new and
more environmentally friendly
materials
, however, still not all materials can be recycled
(Allwood 2014)
.

However,
l

could
increase
risks of desertification, land degradation, and food insecurity
(IPCC 2019a)
, and higher water withdrawals
(Hasegawa et al. 2018; Fuhrman et al. 2020)
,
though this may be at least
partially offset by
