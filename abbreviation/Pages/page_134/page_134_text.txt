inal energy demand from buildings reached 128

in 2019
(around
31% of global final energy demand

and
electricity demand
from buildings
was slightly above 43 EJ

Residential buildings
consumed 70%

of
the
global final energy demand from buildings.
Over the period 1990

global CO

emissions from buildings increased by 50%, global final energy demand
from buildings
grew by 38% and global final electricity demand increased by 161%

In most regions, historical improvements in efficiency have been approximately matched by
growth
in floor area per capita
(
high confidence
).
At the global level, building specific drivers of
GHG emissions include
:
(i) population growth, especially in developing countries
;
(ii) increas
ing
floor
area per capita, driven by the increas
ing
size of dwelling
s while the size of households kept decreasing,
especially in developed countries
;
(iii) the inefficiency of newly constructed buildings, especially in
developing countries, and the low renovation rates and
low
ambition level in developed countries when
ex
isting buildings are renovated
;
iv) the increase in use, number and size of appliances and equipment,
especially Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and cooling, driven by income
;
and
,
(v) the continued reliance on carbon intensive electricity
and heat. These factors taken together are
projected to continue driving
increas
ed
GHG emissions in the building sector in the future
.

Bu
ilding sector
GHG emissions were assessed using the Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewable
(
SER
)
framework. Sufficiency measures tackle the causes of GHG emissions by
limiting
the demand for
energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and
appliances (
high confidence
).
In Chapter
9
of this report
,
s
ufficiency
differs from
efficiency
.
Sufficiency
is about long
-
term actions driven by non
-
technological solutions, which consume less
energy
in absolute term
s.
Efficiency
, in contrast
is about
continuous short
-
term marginal technological improvements.
Use of
the
SER framework
reduces the
cost
of constructing and using buildings without reducing occupantâ€™s well
-
being and comfort
.
{

}
Sufficiency interventions do not consume energy during the use phase of buildings and do not
require maintenance nor replacement over the
lifetime of buildings
. Density, compacity,
bioclimatic design to optimise the use of
nature

based solutions
, multi
-
functionality of space through
shared space and to allow for adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households,
circular
use of materials and repurposing unused existing buildings to avoid using virgin materials,
optimisation of the use of buildings through lifestyle changes, use of the thermal mass of buildings to
reduce thermal needs, moving from ownership to usership of a
ppliances are among the sufficiency
interventions implemented in leading municipalities (
high confidence
). At a global level, up to 17% of
the mitigation potential
in the buildings sector
could be captured by 2050 through sufficiency
interventions
(
medium
confidence
)
.

The potential associated with sufficiency measures
,
as well as the replacement of appliances,
equipment and lights by efficient ones
,
is
below zero
cost (
high confidence
).
The construction of

is expected to
become a business

here have been many examples of deep retrofits where
additional costs per CO

for the whole building stock they tend to be in cost intervals of
