Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG
III
Global climate finance is heavily focused on mitigation (more than 90% on average between 2017
-
2020)
(
high confiden
ce
)
{
15.4, 15.5}
.
This is despite the significant economic effects of climate
changeâ€™s expected physical impacts, and the increasing awareness of these effects on financial stability.
To meet the needs for rapid deployment of mitigation options, global mit
igation investments are
expected to need to increase by the factor of
three
to
six
(
high confidence
). The gaps represent a major
challenge for developing countries, especially
Least Developed Countries (
LDCs
)
, where flows have to
increase by
the
factor
of
four
to
eight
for specific sectors like AFOLU, and for specific groups with
limited access to, and high costs of, climate finance (

The
actual size of sectoral and regional climate financing gaps is only one
component driving the magnitude

upstream funding needs as well as R&D and venture capital for development of new technologies and
