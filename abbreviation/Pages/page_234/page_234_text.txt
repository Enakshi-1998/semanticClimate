Equity and fairness
E
quity and fairness can serve as both driv
er and barrier to climate mitigation at different scales of
governance. Literature regularly highlights equity and justice issues as critical components in local politics
and international diplomacy regarding all SDG, such as goals for no poverty, zero hun
ger, gender equality,
affordable clean energy, reducing inequality, but also for climate action (Goal 13)
(Marmot and Bell 2018;
Spijker
s 2018)
. Equity issues
help explain
why it
has proved hard to
reach more substantive
global
agreement
s
, as it is hard to agree on
a
level of greenhouse gas mitigation (or emissions) and how
to distribute
mitigation
efforts
among countries
(Kverndokk 2018)
for several
reasons. First, an optimal trade
-
off
between mitigation costs and damage costs of climate change depe
nds on ethical considerations
, and
simulations
from
integrated assessment models us
ing
different ethical parameters produc
ing
different
optimal mitigation paths
,
see
(IPCC 2018b
and
Section 3.6.1.2 in
Chapter 3
)
. Second, treaties
that are
considered unfair may be hard to implement
(Liu et al. 2017; Klinsky et al. 2017)
. Lessons from
experimental economics show that people may not accept a distribution that is considered unfair, even if
there is a cost of not accepting
(Gampfer 2014)
. As equity issues are important for reaching deep
decarbonisation,
the transition towards a sustainable development
(Okereke 2018; Evans and Phelan 2016;
Heffron and McCauley 2018)
depend
s
on taking equity seriously in climate policies and international
negotiations
(Martinez et al. 2019; Okereke and Coventry 2016; Klinsky et al. 2017)
.
C
limate change and
climate policies affect countries and people differently
L
ow
-
income countries tend to
be more dependent on primary industries (agriculture, fisheries, etc.) than
richer
countries, and their
infrastructure
may be less robust to tackle more severe weather c
onditions.
W
ithin a country, the burden
s
may not be equally distributed
either
,
due to
policy measures
implemented
and from
d
ifferences in
vulnerability and adaptive capacity
following from
e.g.
income
and
wealth
distribution
, race
and gender.
For instance,
unequal social structures can result in women being more vulnerable to the effects of climate
change compared to men
, especially in poor countries
(Jost et al. 2016; Rao et al. 2019; Arora
-
Jonsson
2011)
. Costs of mitigation also differ across countries. Studies show there are large disparities of economic
impacts of NDCs across regions, and also between relatively similar countries whe
n it comes to the level
of development, due to large differences in marginal abatement cost for the emission reduction
goal
of
NDCs
(Akimoto et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; Hof et al. 2017)
.
E
qualizing the
burdens from c
limate policies may g
ive more support for mitigation policies
(Maestre

Andr√©s et al. 2019)
.
T
aking equity into account in designing an i
nternational climate agreement is complicated as there is no
single universally accepted equity criteri
on
, and countries may strategically choose a criterion that favours
them
(Lange et al. 2007, 2010)
. Still, several studies analyse the consequences of different social
preferences in designing climate agreements, such as for inst
ance inequality aversion, sovereignty and
altruism
(Anthoff et al. 2010; Kverndokk et al. 2014)
.
International t
ransfers

to
support mitigation and a
daptation activities

UNFCCC

1.4.7
Social innovation and beh
aviour change
S
ocial and psychological factors
affect both perceptions and behaviour
(Whitmarsh et al. 202
1; Weber
2015)
. Religion, values, culture, gender, identity, social status and habits strongly influence individual
behaviours and choices and therefore, sustainable consumption
(

.
I
dentities can provide powerful attachments to consumption activities and objects that
inhibit shifts away from them
