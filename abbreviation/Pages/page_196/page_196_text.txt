Mitigation in the context of sustainable development
Accelerating
climate mitigation
in the context of sustainable development
involves not only expediting
the pace of change but also addressing
the underlying drivers of vulnerability
and
emissions
.
Add
ressing these drivers
can
enable
diverse
communities, sectors, stakeholders, regions and cultures to
participate in just, equitable and inclusive processes that improve
the health and well
-
being of
people
and the planet
.
Looking at climate change from a justice perspective
also
means placing the
emphasis
on
:
i
) the protection of vulnerable populations from the impacts of climate change,
ii
) mitigating
the
effects of
low
-
carbon
transformations, and
iii
) ensuring an equitable decarboni
s
ed
world
(
high
confidence
).

The SDG framework
25
can serve as a template
to
evaluate
the long
-
term implications of mitigation
on
sustainable development and vice versa (
high confidence
).
Understanding
the
co
-
benefits and
trade
-
offs associated with mitigation is key
to
understanding how societ
ies
prioriti
s
e among the
various sectoral policy options (
medium
confidence
).
Areas with anticipated trade
-
offs include food
and biodiversity, energy af
fordability/access, and mineral resource extraction. Areas with anticipated
co
-
benefits include health, especially regarding air pollution, clean energy access and water availability.
T
he possible implementation of the different sectoral mitigation options
t
h
erefore
depend
s
on
how
societies prioritise mitigation versus other products and services
: no
t
least,
how
societies
prioritise
food, material well
-
being, nature conservation and biodiversity protection, as well as considerations
such as
their
future dependence on CDR
.
Figure TS.29 summarises the assessment of
where key
synergies and trade
-
offs
exist
between mitigation options and
the SDGs.

The
beneficial and adverse
impacts of
deploying
climate
-
change
mitigation and adaptation
responses
are highly context
-
specific and scale
-
dependent. There are synergies and trade
-
offs
between
adaptation and mitigation as well as synergies and trade
-
offs with sustainable
development
(
high confidence
).
S
trong link
s
also
exists between sustainable developme
nt,
vulnerability and climate risks, as limited economic, social and institutional resources often result in
low adaptive capacities and high vulnerability, especially in developing countries. Resource limitations
in these countries can similarly weaken th
e capacity for climate mitigation and adaptation. The move
towards climate
-
resilient societies requires transformational or deep systemic change. This has
important implications
for
countriesâ€™ sustainable development pathways
(medium evidence, high
agreeme
nt)

The 17 SDGs are at the heart of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by
all United Nations Member States in 2015.
