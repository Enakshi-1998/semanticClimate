Shifting development path
way
s to increase sustainability and broaden mitigation
options
In th
is
report,
development pathways
refer to
the
patterns of development resulting from multiple
decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether
in developing or developed regions follows its own pattern of growth
(
Figure TS.13
)
. Development
pathways ca
n also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities) and for sectoral systems.
Development pathways are major drivers of GHG emissions {1, 2}. There is compelling evidence to
show that continuing along existing development pathways will not
achieve rapid and deep emission
reductions. In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy
instruments may not be able to limit global emissions to a degree sufficient to meet ambitious mitigation
goals or they may only be
able to do so at very high economic and social costs.
Policies to shift development pathways, on the other hand, make mitigation policies more effective.
Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between sustainable development
objectives and mitigation. Development pathways also determin
e the enablers and levers available for
adaptation

and for achieving other SDGs.
There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of
other development objectives can go hand in hand

, Fig 3.33, Chapters 6

}
. Integrated
policies can support the creation of synergies between
action to combat
climate change
and its impacts
(SDG 13) and
other SDGs
.
For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined
with electrifi
cation and clean renewable energy, there are several co
-
benefits to be attained. These
include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co
-
benefits from
cleaner air and benefits from enhanced mobility
{

,

}
. Ene
rgy efficiency in buildings and
energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also deliver significant health
benefits
.

}
However, decisions about mitigation actions, and their timing and scale, may entail
trade
-
offs with the
achievement of other national development objectives in the near
-
, mid
-
and long
-
term {Chapter 12}.
In the near
-
term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and
local air pollution but reduce mo
bility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps
on housing prices may involve trade
-
offs with affordable housing and push low
-
income residents
outside the city
{
8.2.2
}
. In the mid
-
and long
-
term, large
-
scale deployment of biomass ener
gy raises
concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation
{
3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2, 12.5.3
}
.
Prioriti
s
ing is one way to manage these trade
-
offs, addressing some national development objectives
earlier than others. Another way is to a
dopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways
towards sustainability (SDPS) as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve
multiple development objectives and accelerate mitigation
.

What does
shifti
ng development pathways towards
sustainability
entail?
Shifting development pathways towards sustainability implies making transformative changes that
disrupt existing developmental trends. Such choices would not be marginal, but include technological,
systemic and socio
-
behavioural changes
{4.4}
. Decision poi
nts also arise with new infrastructure,
sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence
-
based and integrated decision
-
making,
financial alignment towards low
-
carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in
behaviour
and norms to support shifts away from fossil
fuel consumption. Adopting multi
-
level
governance modes, tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social
and political trust are also key for aligning and supporting long
-
te
rm environmentally just policies and
processes
