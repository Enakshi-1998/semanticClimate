Greater public

private cooperation can also encourage the private sector to
increase and broaden investments, within a context of safeguards and standards, and this can be
integrated into national climate change policies and plans

Ambitious global climate policy coordination and stepped

up publi

climate financing over the
next decade (2021

2030) can
help redirect capital markets and overcome cha

the need for parallel investments in mitigation
.
It can also help address macroeconomic
uncertainty and alleviate developing countries’ debt burden post

(high confidence)
.
Providing strong climate policy signals helps guide inv
estment decisions. Credible signalling by
governments and the international community can reduce uncertainty for financial decision
-
makers and
help reduce transition risk. In addition to indirect and direct subsidies, the public sector’s role in
addressing
market failures, barriers, provision of information, and risk sharing can encourage the
efficient mobilisation of private sector finance
(high confidence).
{15.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.2
}
The mutual
benefits of coordinated support for climate mitigation and adapta
tion in the next decade for both
developed and developing regions could potentially be very high in the post
-
COVID
era
.
Climate
compatible stimulus packages
could significantly reduce the macro
-
financial uncertainty generated by
the pandemic and
increase t
he
sustainability of the world economic recovery.
{15.2, 15.3.2.3, 15.5.2,
15.6.1, 15.6.7}
Political leadership and intervention remain central to addressing uncertainty, which is
a fundamental barrier for the redirection of financial flows. Existing policy misalignments
–
for example
in fossil fuel subsidies
–
undermine the credibility of publi
c commitments, reduce perceived transition
risks and limit financial sector action
(high confidence).
{15.2, 15.3.3, 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.3}
The greater the urgency of action to remain on a 1.5°C pathway
,
the greater need for parallel
investment decisions
in upstream and downstream parts of the value chain
(
high confidence)
.
Greater urgency also reduces the lead times to build trust in regulatory frameworks. Consequently,
many investment decisions will need to be made based on the long
-
term global goals. Th
is highlights
the importance of trust in political leadership which, in turn, affects risk perception and ultimately
financing costs
(high confidence).

Accelerated international cooperation

the enabling operational definitions. A coordinated effort to green the post

also
essential in countries facing much higher debt costs. (
