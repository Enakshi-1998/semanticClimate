projected GDP growth in assessed modelled global scenarios that quantify the macroeconomic
implications of climate change mitigation, but that do not account for damages from climate change nor
adaptation costs (
high confidence
). For example, compared to pathways that assume the continuation
of policies implemented by the end of 2020, assessed global GDP reached in 2050 is reduced by 1.3–
2.7% in modelled pathways assuming coordinated global action starting between now and 2025 at the
latest to limit warming to 2°C (>67%). The corresponding average reduction in annual global GDP
growth over 2020-2050 is 0.04–0.09 percentage points. In assessed modelled pathways, regardless of
the level of mitigation action, global GDP is projected to at least double (increase by at least 100%)
over 2020-2050. For modelled global pathways in other temperature categories, the reductions in global
GDP in 2050 compared to pathways that assume the continuation of policies implemented by the end
of 2020 are as follows:
2.6 - 4.2% (C1), 1.6 - 2.8% (C2), 0.8 - 2.1% (C4), 0.5 - 1.2% (C5). The
corresponding reductions in average annual global GDP growth over 2020-2050, in percentage points,
are as follows: 0.09 - 0.14 (C1), 0.05 - 0.09 (C2), 0.03 - 0.07 (C4), 0.02 - 0.04 (C5)
[FOOTNOTE 67].
There are large variations in the modelled effects of mitigation on GDP across regions, depending
notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international
cooperation [FOOTNOTE 68] (
high confidence
). Country level studies also show large variations in
the effect of mitigation on GDP depending notably on the level of mitigation and on the way it is
achieved (
high confidence
). Macroeconomic implications of mitigation co-benefits and trade-offs are
not quantified comprehensively across the above scenarios and depend strongly on mitigation strategies
(
high confidence
). {3.6, 4.2, Box TS.7, Annex III I.2, I.9, I.10 and II.3}
FOOTNOTE 67:
These estimates are based on 311 pathways that report effects of mitigation on GDP
and that could be classified in temperature categories, but that do not account for damages from climate
change nor adaptation costs and that mostly do not reflect the economic impacts of mitigation co-
benefits and trade-offs. The ranges given are interquartile ranges. The macroeconomic implications
quantified vary largely depending on technology assumptions, climate/emissions target formulation,
model structure and assumptions, and the extent to which pre-existing inefficiencies are considered.
Models that produced the pathways classified in temperature categories do not represent the full
diversity of existing modelling paradigms, and there are in the literature models that find higher
mitigation costs, or conversely lower mitigation costs and even gains. {1.7, 3.2, 3.6, Annex III I.2 I.9
I.10 and II.3}
FOOTNOTE 68:
In modelled cost-effective pathways with a globally uniform carbon price, without
international financial transfers or complementary policies, carbon intensive and energy exporting
countries are projected to bear relatively higher mitigation costs because of a deeper transformation of
their economies and changes in international energy markets. {3.6}
C.12.3
Estimates of aggregate economic benefits from avoiding damages from climate change, and
from reduced adaptation costs, increase with the stringency of mitigation (
high confidence
). Models
that incorporate the economic damages from climate change find that the global cost of limiting
warming to 2°C over the 21st century is lower than the global economic benefits of reducing warming,
unless: i) climate damages are towards the low end of the range; or, ii) future damages are discounted
at high rates (
medium confidence
) [FOOTNOTE 69]. Modelled pathways with a peak in global
emissions between now and 2025 at the latest, compared to modelled pathways with a later peak in
global emissions, entail more rapid near-term transitions and higher up-front investments, but bring
long-term gains for the economy, as well as earlier benefits of avoided climate change impacts (
high
confidence
). The precise magnitude of these gains and benefits is difficult to quantify. {1.7, 3.6, Cross-
