Land

based, long

range, heavy
-
duty trucks can be decarbonised through battery
-
electric haulage
(including the use of
e
lectric
r
oad
s
ystems), complemented by hydro
gen
-
and biofuel
-
based fuels
in some contexts. These same technologies and expanded use of available electric rail systems can
support rail decarbonisation
(medium confidence
)
.
Initial deployments of battery
-
electric, hydrogen
-
and bio
-
based haulage are un
derway, and commercial operations of some of these technologies are
considered feasible by 2030
(medium confidence)
. These technologies nevertheless face challenges
regarding driving range, capital and operating costs, and infrastructure availability. In p
articular, fuel
cell durability, high energy consumption, and costs continue to challenge the commercialisation of
hydrogen
-
based fuel cell vehicles. Increased capacity for low
-
carbon hydrogen production would also
be essential for hydrogen
-
based fuels to
serve as an emissions reduction strategy
(high confidence)
.

Decarbonisation options for shipping and aviation still require R&D, though advanced biofuels,
ammonia, and synthetic fuels are emerging as viable
options
(medium confidence
).
Increased
efficiency has been insufficient to limit the emissions from shipping
and aviation, and natural gas
-
based
fuels are
expected to be
inadequate to meet stringent decarbonisation goals for these segments (
high
confidence
).
High energy density, low carbon fuels are required, but they have not yet reached
commercial scale. Advanc
ed biofuels could provide low carbon jet fuel (
medium confidence
).
The
production of synthetic fuels using low
-
carbon hydrogen with CO
2
captured through DAC
CS
/BECCS
could provide jet and marine fuels but these options still require demonstration at scale (
low confidence
).
Ammonia produced with low
-
carbon hydrogen could also serve as a marine fuel (
medium confidence
).
Deployment of these fuels requires reductions in production costs.

S
cenarios from
bottom

up and top
-
down models indicate that
,
without intervention, CO
2
emissions from transport could grow in the range of
16% and 50%
by 2050
(
medium confidence)
.
The scenarios literature projects continued growth in demand for freight and passenger servi
ces,
particularly in developing countries in Africa and Asia (
high confidence
). This growth is projected to
take place across all transport modes. Increases in demand notwithstanding, scenarios that limit
warming to 1.5
°C degree with no or
l
imited
overshoot
suggest that a 59% reduction (42
-
68%
interquartile range) in transport
-
related CO
2
emissions by 2050, compared to modelled 2020 levels is
required.
While many global scenarios place greater reliance on emissions reduction in sectors other
than tr
ansport,
a quarter of the 1.5
°C
scenarios describe transport
-
related CO
2
emissions reductions in
excess of 68% (relative to modelled 2020 levels) (
medium confidence)
.

describe emission reductions
of 80% and 90% in the transport sector,
respectively, by 2050
.
Transport

related emission reductions, however, may not happen uniformly
across regions. For example, transport emissions from the Developed Countries, and Eastern Europe
and West
-
Central Asia
countries decrease from 2020 levels by 2050 across all scenarios
limiting global
warming to
1.5
°C
by 2100
, but could increase in Africa, Asia and developing Pacific (APC), Latin
America and Caribbean, and the Middle East in some of these scenarios.
{10.7}
The scenarios literature indicates that fuel and technology shifts are crucial
in
reducing carbon
emissions to meet
temperature goals
(
high confidence
)
.
In
general terms, electrification tends to play
the key role in land
-
based transport, but biofuels and hydrogen (and derivatives) could play a role in
decarbonisation of freight in some contexts. Biofuels and hydrogen (and derivatives) are
expected to be
mor
e prominent in shipping and aviation. The shifts towards these alternative fuels must occur
alongside shifts towards clean technologies in other sectors
.
{10.7}
There is a growing awareness of the need to plan for the significant expansion of low
-
carbon
en
ergy infrastructure, including low
-
carbon power generation and hydrogen production, to
support emissions reductions in
the transport sector (
high confidence
).
