Chapter 1
IPCC
AR6 WGIII
Executive Summary
Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continued to rise to 2019: the aggregate reductions
implied by current
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to 2030 would still make it
impossible to limit warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited overshoot, and would only be compatible
with
likely limiting warming
below 2
°
C if followed by much steeper decline, hence limitin
g
warming to either level implies accelerated mitigation actions at all scales
(
robust evidence, high
agreement)
.
Since
the
IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), important changes that have emerged
include the specific
objectives
established in the Paris Agreement
of 2015 (for temperature, adaptation
and finance), rising climate impacts
,
and
higher
levels of societal awareness
and support for climate
action
.
The growth of global GHG emissions has slowed over the past
decade, and delivering the
updated NDCs to 2030 would turn this into decline
,
but
the
implied global emissions by 2030 exceed
pathways consistent with
1.5
°
C by a large margin, and
are near the upper end of the range of modelled
pathways which keep temperat
ures
likely
below 2
°
C
.
Continuing investments in carbon
-
intensive
activities
at scale will
heighten the
multitude of
risks
associated with climate change
and
impede societal
and industrial transformation towards low carbon
development.
Meeting the
long
-
term temperature
objective
in the Paris Agreement therefore implies a rapid turn to an accelerating
decline of GHG
emissions towards ‘net zero’, which is implau
sible
without
urgent and ambitious action
at all scales
.
The unprecedented COVID
-
19 pandemic has had far
-
reaching impacts on
the
global economic and
social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation

While there are some trade
-
offs, effective and equitable climate policies are largely compatible
with the broader goal of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate
poverty
as enshrined in
the 17 Sustainable D
evelopment Goals
(SDGs)
(
robust evidence, high agreement
)
.
Climate mitigation
is one of many goals that societies pursue in the context of sustainable development, as
evidenced
by
the wide range of
the
SDGs
.
Climate mitigation has synergies and/or trade
-
offs with
many other SDGs.
Th
ere has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per
capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation.
However, recent evidence shows
countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions.
Countries have different priorities in
achieving the SDGs
and reducing emissions
as
informed
by their respective national conditions and
capabilities.
Given the differences in
GHG emissions contributions
,
degree of vulnerabilities and
impacts, as well as c
apacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important
considerations for effective climate policy and for securing
national and international support for deep
decarbonisation.
A
chiev
ing
sustainable global development and eradicat
ing
poverty as enshrined in the
17
SDGS would involve
effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale
.
Failure to address
questions of equity and justice
over time can undermine
social cohesion and stability.
International co
-
operation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the
context of sustainable development

The transition to a low carbon economy depen
ds on a wide range of
closely intertwined
drivers
and constraints
, including policies and
technologies
where notable advances
over the past decade
have opened up new and large
-
scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative
development pa
thways which could deliver multiple social and developmental goals
(
robust
evidence, medium agreement).
Drivers for and constraints against low carbon societal transition
comprise
economic and technological
factors (
t
he means by which services
such as food, heating and
shelter
are provided and for whom, the
emissions intensity of traded products, finance
,
and investment
)
,
socio
-
political issues
(
political economy, equity and fairness,
social innovation and behaviour change
)
,
and
institutional fa
ctors
(
legal framework and institutions
, and the quality of international cooperation
)
.
In addition to being deeply intertwined all the factors matter
to varying degrees,
depending on prevailing
