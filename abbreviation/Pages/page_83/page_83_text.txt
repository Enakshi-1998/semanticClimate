gases would achieve such long

term temperature goals at close to least global cost wi
thin a few percent
(
high confidence
).
However, GWP
100
is not well suited to estimate the cumulative effect on climate from sustained SLCF
emissions and the resulting warming at specific points in time. This is because the warming caused by
an individual SL
CF emission pulse is not permanent, and hence, unlike CO
2
, the warming from
successive SLCF emission pulses over multiple decades or centuries depends mostly on their ongoing
rate of emissions rather than cumulative emissions. Recently developed step/pulse
metrics such as the
CGTP (Combined Global Temperature Change Potential) and GWP
*
(referred to as GWP
-
star
and
indicated by asteri
sk
) recognise that a sustained increase/decrease in the rate of SLCF emissions has
indeed a similar effect on global sur
face temperature as one
-
off emission/removal of CO
2
. These metrics
use this relationship to calculate the CO
2
emissions or removals that would result in roughly the same
temperature change as a sustained change in the rate of SLCF emissions (CGTP) over a g
iven time
period, or as a varying time series of CH
4
emissions (GWP*). From a mitigation perspective, this makes
these metrics well suited in principle to estimate the effect on the remaining carbon budget from more,
or less, ambitious SLCF mitigation over
multiple decades compared to a given reference scenario (
high
confidence
). However, potential application in wider climate policy (e.g.
,
to inform equitable and
ambitious emission targets or to support sector
-
specific mitigation policies) is contested and relevant
literature still limited.
All metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physic
al
climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. For this reason, the WG
III
contribution to the AR6 reports emissions and mitigation options for individual gases where possible;
CO
2
-
equivalent emissions are reported in addition to indi
vidual gas emissions where this is judged to
be policy
-
relevant. This approach aims to reduce the ambiguity regarding actual climate outcomes over
time arising from the use of any specific GHG emission
metric. {Cross

Emission metrics also exist for aerosols, but these are not commonly used in climate policy. This assessment
focuses on GHG emission metrics only.

Consumption

based CO

emissions in developed countries and the Asia and Developing Pacific
region are higher than in other regions
(high confidence).
In developed countries, consumption
-
based CO
2
emissions peaked at 15
GtCO
2
in 2007,
declining to about 13 GtCO
2
in 2018.
The Asia and

52
% of current global population, has become a major contributor to
consumption

Carbon intensity improvements in the production of traded products has led to a net reduction
in CO
2
emissions embodied in international trade
(
high confidence
).
A decrease in the carbon
intensity of traded products has offset increased trade volumes
between 2006 and 2016
. Emissions
embodied in internationally traded products depend on the composition of
the global supply chain
across sectors and countries and the respective carbon intensity of production processes (emissions per
unit of economic output). {2.3, 2.4}
