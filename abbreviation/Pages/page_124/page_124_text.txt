TS. 5.2
Urban and other
s
ettlements
Although urbani
s
ation is a global trend often associated with increased
incomes and higher
consumption, the growing concentration of people and activities is an opportunity to increase
resource efficiency and decarboni
s
e at
scale
(very high confidence)
.
The same urbani
s
ation level can
have large variations in per capita urban
carbon emissions. For most regions, per capita urban emissions
are lower than per capita national emissions
(very high confidence
)
.
{8.1.4, 8.3.3, 8.4, Box 8.1}
Most future urban population growth will occur in developing countries, where per capita
emissions are currently low but are expected to increase with the construction and use of new
infrastructure and the built environment, and changes in incomes and life
styles
(very high
confidence)
.
The drivers of urban GHG emissions are complex and include an interplay of population
size, income, state of urbani
s
ation, and how cities are laid out. How new cities and towns are designed,
constructed, managed, and powered
will lock
-
in behaviour, lifestyles, and future urban GHG emissions.
Urban strategies
can improve well
-
being while minimi
s
ing impact on GHG emissions
. However,
urbani
s
ation can
result in
increased global GHG emissions through emissions outside the city’s
b
oundaries
(very high confidence)
.
{8.1.4, 8.3, Box 8.1, 8.4, 8.6}
The urban share of
combined
global (CO
2
and CH
4
emissions
is substanti
al
and continues to
increase
(high confidence)
.
Urban areas generated between 67
–
72% (~28 GtCO
2
-
eq) of combined
global CO
2
and CH
4
emissions in 2020
through the production and consumption of goods and services.
These emissions are projected to rise to 34
–
65 GtCO
2
-
eq by 2050 with moderate to no mitigation efforts,
driven by a growing population, infrastructure, and s
ervice demands in urban areas
.
About 100 of the
highest emitting urban areas account for approximately 18% of the global carbon footprint
(high
confidence)
.
{8.1.6, 8.3.3}
The urban share of regional GHG emissions increased between 2000 and 2015, with much
inter
-
region
al
variation in the magnitude of the increase
(high confidence).
Globally, the urban share of
national emissions increased
six
percentage points, from 56% in 2000 to 62% in 2015. For 2000 to
2015, the urban emissions share increased from 28% to 38% in Africa, from 46% to 54% in Asia and
Developing Pacific, from 62% to 72% in Developed Countries, from 57% to 62% in Eastern Europe
a
nd West
-
Central Asia, from 55% to 66% in Latin America and Caribbean, and from 68% to 69% in
the Middle East
(high confidence)
.
{8.1.6, 8.3.3}
Per capita urban GHG emissions increased between 2000 and 2015, with cities in
d
eveloped
c
ountries
accounting for
nearly seven times more per capita than the lowest emitting region
(medium confidence)
.
From 2000 to 2015, global urban GHG emissions per capita increased from 5.5
to 6.2 tCO

per
person (an increase of 11.8%)
. Emissions in
Africa increased from 1.3 to
1.5 tCO

in
Asia and Developing Pacific from 3.0 to 5.1 tCO

Central Asia from 6.9 to 9.8 tCO
