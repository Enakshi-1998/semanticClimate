C.1
Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025
in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot
and in those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) and assume immediate action.
[ Table SPM footnote [#9],
FOOTNOTE 38]
In both types of modelled pathways, rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions
follow throughout 2030, 2040 and 2050 (
high confidence
). Without a strengthening of policies
beyond those that are implemented by the end of 2020, GHG emissions are projected to rise
beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5] °C by 2100
[FOOTNOTE
39, 40] (
medium confidence
). (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.4, Figure SPM.5) {3.3, 3.4}
FOOTNOTE 38:
All reported warming levels are relative to the period 1850–1900. If not otherwise
specified, ‘pathways’ always refer to pathways computed with a model. Immediate action in the
pathways refers to the adoption of climate policies between 2020 and at latest 2025 intended to limit
global warming at a given level.
FOOTNOTE 39:
Long-term warming is calculated from all modelled pathways assuming mitigation
efforts consistent with national policies that were implemented by the end of 2020 (scenarios that fall
into policy category P1b of Chapter 3) and that pass through the 2030 GHG emissions ranges of such
pathways assessed in Chapter 4
(See FOOTNOTE 25) {3.2, Table 4.2}
FOOTNOTE 40:
Warming estimates refer to the 50th and [5th–95th] percentile across the modelled
pathways and the median temperature change estimate of the probabilistic WG I climate model
emulators[Footnote 1
]
(Table SPM1).
C.1.1
Net global GHG emissions are projected to fall from 2019 levels by 27% [13–45%] by 2030
and 63% [52-76%]
[FOOTNOTE 41] by 2050 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C
(>67%) and assuming immediate action (category C3a, Table SPM.1). This compares with reductions
of 43% [34–60%] by 2030 and 84% [73–98%] by 2050 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot (C1, Table SPM.1) (
high confidence
).[ [FOOTNOTE 42] In
modelled pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot [FOOTNOTE 43],
GHG emissions are reduced by 23 [0-44%] in 2030 and by 75 [62-91%] in 2050 (C2, Table SPM.1)
(high confidence
). Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until
2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global
warming of 2.8°C [2.1-3.4°C] by 2100 (
medium confidence
). [FOOTNOTE 24] (Figure SPM .4).

FOOTNOTE 41:
In this report, emissions reductions are reported relative to 2019 modelled emission
levels, while in SR1.5 emissions reductions were calculated relative to 2010. Between 2010 and 2019
global GHG and global CO
2
emissions have grown by 12% (6.5 GtCO
2
eq) and 13% (5.0 Gt CO
2
)
respectively. In global modelled pathways assessed in this report that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%)
with no or limited overshoot, GHG emissions are projected to be reduced by 37% [28-57%] in 2030
relative to 2010. In the same type of pathways assessed in SR1.5, GHG emissions are reduced by 45%
(40-60% interquartile range) relative to 2010. In absolute terms, the 2030 GHG emissions levels of
pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot are higher in AR6 (31 [21-
36] GtCO
2
eq) than in SR1.5 (28 (26-31 interquartile range) GtCO
2
eq). (Figure SPM. 1, Table SPM.1)
