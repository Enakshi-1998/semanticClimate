Chapter 1
IPCC
AR6 WGIII
Change (UNFCCC), the UN agre
ements on Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai) and Finance for
Development (Addis Ababa), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Paris Agreement (PA).
The Paris Agreement aims to “hold the increase in the global average
temperature to well below 2
°C above pre
-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre
-
industrial levels”
(UNFCCC 2015)
, alongside goals for adaptation (IPCC
WGII), and ‘aligning financial flows’ (below) , so as “to strengthen the global response to the threat of
climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”
The Paris Agre
ement is predicated on encouraging progressively ambitious climate action from all
countries on the basis of Nationally Determined Contributions
(Rajamani 2016; Clémençon 2016).
The
NDC approach requires countries to set their own level of ambitions for climate change mitigation but
within a collaborative and legally binding process to foster ambition towards the agreed goals
(Falkner
2016a; Bodansky 2016)
. The
P
A
entered into force in November 2016 and as of February 2021 it has
190
Parties (out of
197 Parties to the UNFCCC).
The PA
also underlines “the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances” (P
A
Article 2 para 2)
, and correspondingly
that
“
developed count
ry Parties
should
continue taking the lead by undertaking economy
-
wide absolute
emission reductions
”
.
It states that d
eveloping country Parties should continue enhancing their
mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy
-
wide em
ission reduction or
limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.
The
Paris Agreement
’s
mitigation
goal
implies
“
to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions
by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the
second half of this century”
(
PA
Article
4
para 1
).
The
Paris Agreement
provides for 5
-
yearly stocktakes in which Parties have to take collective
stock on progress towards achieving its purposes and its long
-
term goal in the light of equity and
available b
est science (
PA
Article 14). The first global stocktake is
scheduled for 2023. (
PA
Article 14
para 3).
The Paris Agreement aims to make ‘finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse
gas emissions and climate
-
resilient development’ (PA Art
icle 2.1C).
In keeping with the acknowledged
context of global sustainable development and poverty eradication, and the corresponding aims of
aligning finance and agreed differentiating principles as indicated above, “…the developed country
parties are to
assist developing country parties with financial resources” (
PA
Article 9). The Green
Climate Fund (GCF)
, an operating entity of the UNFCCC Financial Mechanism to finance mitigation
and adaptation efforts in developing countries
(GCF 2020)
,
was given an important role in serving the
Agreement and supporting PA goals.. The GCF gathered pledges worth USD 10.3 billion, from
developed and developing countries, regions, and one city (Paris)
(Antimiani et al. 2017; Bowman and
Minas 2019)
. Financing has since increased b
ut remains short of the goal to mobilise USD100 billion
by 2020 (Chapter 15).
Initiatives contributing to the
Paris Agreement
goals include the Non
-
State Actor Zone for Climate
Action (NAZCA
or now renamed as
Global Climate Action
) portal, launched at COP
20 (
December
2014) in Lima, Peru, to support city
-
based actions for mitigating climate change
(Mead 2015)
and
Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action
which is a UNFCCC
-
backed series of
events
intended
to
facilitate
collaboration between governments and the cities, regions, businesses and investors that
must act on climate change.
