Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
Developed countries tend to be net CO
2
emission importers, whereas developing countries t
end
to be net emission exporters
(
high confidence
).
Net CO
2
emission transfers from developing to
developed countries via global supply chains have decreased between 2006 and 2016
.
Between 2004
and 2011, CO
2
emission embodied in trade between
developing countries have more than doubled (from
0.47 to 1.1 Gt) with the centre of trade activities shifting from Europe to Asia. {2.3.4
, Figure 2.15
}
Territorial e
missions from developing country regions continue to grow,
mo
stly driven by
increased cons
umption and investment, albeit
starting from a low base of per capita emissions
and with
a
lower
historic
contribution
to cumulative emissions than developed countries
(
high
confidence
).

G
lobal
ly, households with income in the top
10% contribute
about 36

45% of global GHG
emissions
(robust evidence, medium agreement)
.
About two thirds of the top 10% live in developed
countries and one third in other economies.
The lifestyle consumption emissions of the middle income
and poorest citizens in emerging economies are between 5

.
Increasing inequality within a country can exacerbate dilemmas
of redistribution and social cohesion and affect the willingness of
the
rich and poor to accept policies
to protect the environment
, and to accept and afford
lif
estyle changes
that favour
mitigation
