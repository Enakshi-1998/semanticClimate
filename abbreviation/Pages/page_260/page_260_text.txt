Building on the SR1.5 assessment framework: feasibility and enabling
conditions
While previous ARs dealt with the definition of alternative mitigation pathways mostly exploring the
technological potentials, latest research focused on what kind of mitigation pathways are feasible in a
broader sense, underlining the multi

dimensional approaches to analysing ‘feasibility’ and ‘enabling conditions’, which AR6 develops
and applies broadly in re

assessment’ (

)
. Two reflect
the physical environment:
•
Geophysical
,
not only the
global risks from climate change bu
t also, for technology assessment, the
global availability of critical resources;
•
Environmental

, including local environmental
constraints and co

benefits
of different
technologies and pathways
The other four dimensions correspond broadly to
the four Analytic Frameworks
outlined in
S
ection 1.7:
•
Economic
, particularly aggregate economic and financial indicators, and SDGs reflecting different
stages and goals of economic development;
•
Socio
-
cultural
, including particularly ethical and justice dimensions, and social and cultural norms;
•
Technological,
includ
ing innovation needs and transitional dynamics associated with new and
emergent technologies
and associated
systems; and
•
Institutional & political,
including
political acceptability, legal and administrative feasibility, and
the capacity and governance re
quirements at different levels to deliver sustained mitigation in the
wider context of sustainable development.
