this group of chapters including the assessment of costs and potentials, demand side aspects of
mitigation, and carbon dioxide

TS. 5.1
Energy
A broad
-
based approach to deploying energy sector mitigation options
can
reduce emissions over
the next ten years and set the stage for still deeper reductions beyond
2030 (
high confidence
).
There are substantial, cost
-
effective opportu
nities to reduce emissions rapidly, including
in
electricity
generation
,
but
near
-
term reductions will not be sufficient to
li
kely
limit warming to 2
°
C
or
limit
warming to
1
.5
°
C
with
no or limited overshoot
.
{6.4, 6.6, 6.7
}
Warming cannot be li
mited to 2
°
C
or 1.5
°
C
without rapid and deep reductions in energy system
CO
2
and GHG emissions
(
high confidence
)
.
In scenarios
likely
limiting warming to 1.5
°
C with
no or
limited overshoot (
likely
below 2
°
C), net energy system CO
2
emissions (interquartile range) fall by 87%
to 97%% (60% to 79%) in 2050. In 2030, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited
overshoot, net CO
2
and GHG emissions fall by 35
-
51% and 38
-
52% respectively. In scenarios limiting
warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited overshoot (
likely
below 2
°
C), net electricity sector CO
2
emissions
reach zero globally between 2045 and 2055 (2050 and 2080)
(high confidence)
.
{6.7}
Limiting warming to 2
°
C
or 1.5
°
C
will require
substantial energy system changes over
the next
30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption, increased production from low
-
and zero
-
carbon energy sources, and increased use of electricity and alternative energy carriers
(
high
confidence
).
Coal consumption without CCS falls by
67% to 82% (interquartile range)
in 2030 in
scenarios limiting warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited overshoot. Oil and gas consumption fall more
slowly. Low
-
carbon sources produce
93% to 97%
of global electricity by 205
0 in scenarios that
likely
limit warming to 2
°
C or below. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited overshoot
(
likely
below 2
°
C), electricity supplies
48% to 58%
(
36% to 47%
) of final energy in 2050, up from 20%
in 2019.

ystems will share
common characteristics, but
the
approach in every country
will depend on national circumstances
(
high confidence
)
.
Common characteristics of net
-
zero energy
systems will include
: (1) electricity systems that produce no net CO
2
or remove CO
2
from the
atmosphere; (2
)
widespread electrification of end uses, including light
-
duty transpo
rt,
space heating,
and cooking; (3) substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today
;
(4) use of alternative energy carriers
such as hydrogen, bio
energy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to
electrification; (5) more efficient use of energy than today; (6
)
greater energy system integration across
regions and across components of the energy system; and (
7)
use of CO
2
removal
including
DACCS
and
BECCS to offset residual emissions.

From 2015
to 2019, global final energy consumption grew by 6.6%, CO

grew by 4.6%, and total GHG emissions from energy supply rose by 2.7%.

emissions
from oil, gas, and coal, accounted for
5.8
% of GHG emissions in 2019. Coal electricity capacity grew
by 7.6% between 2015 and 2019, as new builds in
some countries offset declines in others. Total
consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew by 15%.
