AR6 WGIII
Climate change gov
ernance has been projected as conscious transformation at unprecedented scale and
speed involving a contest of ideas and experimentation across scales of authority and jurisdiction
(Hildén et al. 2017; Laakso et
al. 2017; Gordon 2018; van der Heijden 2018; Kivimaa et al. 2017)
.
Yet,
there remains a sense that achieving the urgent transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and
sustainable world requires significant innovation in governance
(Hoffmann 2011; Stevenson and
Dryzek 2013; Aykut 2016)

long evolved
into a complex polycentric structure that spans from the global to national and sub
-
national levels, with
“multiple parallel initiatives involving a range of actors at different levels of governance”
(Okereke et
al. 2009)
and relying on bo
th formal and informal networks and policy channels
channels
(Bulkeley et
al. 2014; Jordan et al. 2015)
.
At the international level, implementation of the Paris Agreement and the
UNFCCC m
ore broadly is proceeding in parallel with other activities in an increasingly diverse
landscape of loosely coordinated institutions, constituting ’regime complex’
(Keohane and Victor
2011)
, and new cooperative efforts demonstrate an evolution in the shifting authority given to actors at
different level of governance
(Chan et al.
2018)
.
Multi

level governance has been used to highlight the notion that the processes involved in making and
implementing decisions on climate change is no longer the exclusive preserve of government actors but
rather involve a range of non

nation sta
te actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society
organisations
(Bäckstrand et al. 2017; Jordan et al. 2018; IPCC 2014a Chapter 13, 13.3.1 and 13.5.2)
.
Increased multi
-
level participation of subnational actors, along with a divers
ity of other transnational
and non
-
state actors have helped to facilitate increased awareness, experimentation, innovation,
learning and achieving benefits at multiple scales. Multi
-
level participation in governance systems can
help to build coalitions to
support climate change mitigation policies
(Robe
rts et al. 2018)
and
fragmentation has the potential to take cooperative and even synergistic forms
(Biermann et al. 2009)
However, there is
no guarantee that multilevel governance can successfully deal with complex human

ecological systems
(
Biermann et al. 2017; York et al. 2005; Di Gregorio et al. 2019)
. Multi

governance can contribute to an extremely polarised
discussion and policy blockage rather than
enabling policy innovation
(Fisher and Leifeld 2019)
. Fragmented g

coordination and legitimacy gaps undermining the regime

and Bäckstrand 2019)

rather than seeking a single, integrated

(Keohane and Victor 2016)

Crucially, climate gov
ernance takes place in the context of embedded power relations, operating at
global, national and local context. Effective rules and institutions to govern climate change are more
likely to emerge when where power structures and interests favour action. Ho

enduring co

operation can only be expected to when the benefits outweigh the cost of cooperation and
when the interest of key actors are sufficiently aligned
(Barrett 1994; Victor 2011; Finus and R

2008; Tulkens 2019; Mainali et al. 2018)
. Investigating the distribution a

resources, capacities and power relations within and across different jurisdictional levels is therefore
important to uncover hindrances to effective climate governance
(Marquardt 2017)
