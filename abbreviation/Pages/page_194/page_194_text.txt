: Transition
dynamics: levels, policies and processes
. {Figure 1.7}
The
relative importance of different ‘pillars of policy’ differs according to stage of the transition. The lower
panel illustrates growth of innovative technologies or practices, which if successful
,
emerge from niches into an
S
-
shape dynamic of exponential gr
owth. The diffusion stage often involves new infrastructure and
reconfiguration of existing market and regulatory structures. During the phase of more widespread diffusion
,
growth levels off to linear, then slows as the industry and market matures. The pro
cesses displace incumbent
technologies/practices which decline, initially slowly but then at an accelerating pace. Many related literatures
identify three main levels with different characteristics, most generally termed
micro, meso
and
macro
.
B
etter and
more comprehensive data on innovation indicators can provide timely insights for
policy
makers and policy design locally, nationally and internationally, especially for developing
countries, where such insights are
often
missing.
Data needed
include those
that can show the
strength of technological, sectoral and national innovation systems.
It is also necessary to validate
current results and generate insights from theoretical frameworks and empirical studies for developing
countries
’
contexts. Innovation s
tudies on adaptation and mitigation other than energy and ex
-
post
assessments of the effectiveness of various innovation
-
related policies and interventions, including
R&D, would also provide benefits. Furthermore, methodological developments to improve the
ability
of IAMs to capture energy innovation system dynamics and the relevant institutions and policies
(including design and implementation), would allow for more realistic assessment. {16.2, 16.3, 16.7}
