Moving to net negative CO

Reaching net
zero CO
2
emissions
sooner
can
reduce
cumulative CO
2
emissions and
result in less
human
-
induced global warming. Overall human
-
induced warming
depends not only on CO
2
emissions but also
on the contribution from other anthropogenic climate forcers, including aerosols
and
other GHGs
(e.g.
CH
4
and F
-
gases)
.
To halt
total human
-
induced warming, emissions of other GHG, in particular
CH
4
,
need to be st
rongly reduced.

etween 2070

2075 (2055

; 90% of pathways
). This is later
than assessed in the
AR6
SR1.5 primarily due to more pathways in the literature that approach net
-
ze
ro
CO
2
emissions more gradually
after a rapid decline of emissions until 2040
.
(Box TS.6 Figure 1)
It does not mean that the world has more time for emissions reductions while still limiting warming to
1.5

C than reported in the SR15.
It only means that the exact timing of reaching net zero CO
2
after a
steep decline of CO
2
emissions until
2040 can show some variation
. T
he SR1.5 median value of 2050
is
still
close to
the middle of the current range
.
If emissions are reduced less rapidly
in the period
up to
2030, an earlier net
-
zero year is needed.
Reaching net zero GHG emissions requires net negative CO
2
emissions to balance residual CH
4
, N
2
O
and F
-
gas emissions. If achieved globally, net zero GHG emissions would reduce global warming fr
om
an earlier peak.
Around half global emission pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C, and a third of
pathways
likely
to
limit warming to 2°C, reach net zero GHG emissions (based on GWP
100
) in the
second half of the century, around 10
-
40 years later than net
zero CO
2
emissions. They show warming
being halted at some peak value followed by a gradual decline towards the end of the century. The
remainder of the pathways do not reach net zero GHG emissions during the 21st century and show little
decline of warming
after it stabilised.
Global net zero CO
2
or GHG emissions can be achieved even while some sectors and regions continue
to be net emitters, provided that others
achieve
net
GHG removal
.
Sectors and regions have different
potentials and costs to achieve net zero or even net GHG removal.
The adopti
on and implementation of
net zero emission targets by countries and regions depends on multiple factors, including equity and
capacity criteria
and international and cross
-
sectoral mechanisms to balance emissions and removals
.
The f
ormulation of net zero p
athways by countries will benefit from clarity on scope, plans
-
of
-
action,
and fairness.
Achieving net zero emission targets relies on policies, institutions and milestones against
which to track progress.
