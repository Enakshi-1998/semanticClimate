strongly increasing the challenge
of
likely
limit
ing
warming to 2°
C
(high confidence)
.
A high
overshoot of 1.5°C increases the risks from climate impacts and i
ncreases dependence on large scale
carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. A future consistent with current NDCs implies higher
fossil fuel deployment and lower reliance on low carbon alternatives until 2030, compared to mitigation
pathways
describing
immediate action
that limits warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, or
likely
limit
s
warming to 2°C and below.
After following the NDCs to 2030, t
o
likely
limit warming to
2°C
t
he pace of global GHG emission reductions would need to
abruptly increase
from 2030 onward to
an average of 1.3
-
2.1 GtCO
2
-
eq per year between 2030 and 2050
.
This
is similar to
the
global CO
2
emission reductions in 2020
that occurred
due to the COVID
-
19 pan
demic
lockdowns
, and around 70%
faster than in pathways
where immediate action is taken to
likely
limit warming to 2°C. Accelerating
emission reductions after following an NDC pathway to 2030 would
also
be particularly challenging
because of the continued
build
-
up of fossil fuel infrastructure that would take place between now and
2030
.

)
–
make it less challenging to
likely
limit
warming to 2°C after 2030
(medium confidence)
.
The accelerated action pathways are characterized by a global, but regionally
differenti
ated, roll
-
out of regulatory and pricing policies. Compared to
current
NDCs, they
describe
less
fossil fuel
use
and more low
-
carbon fuel
use
until 2030
; they
narrow, but do not close the gap to
pathways
that
assum
e
immediate global action using all available least
-
cost abatement options. All
delayed or accelerated action pathways
likely
limiting warming to below 2°C converge to a global
mitigation regime at some point after 2030 by putting a significant value on red
ucing carbon and other
GHG emissions in all sectors and regions. {3.5}

by the cumulative net CO

emissions until

Cumulative net CO

zero CO

are 510 (330

in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot
and 890 (640

1160) GtCO

in pathways
likely
limiting warming to 2.0°C. These estimates are consistent
