incorporating climate change into national development activities, such as the building of infrastructure
(Wamsler and Pauleit 2016; Runhaar et al. 2018)
. The ‘green economy’ and green growth
–
growth
without undermining ecological systems, partly by gaining economic value from cleaner technologies
and sy
stems and is inclusive and equitable in its outcomes
-
has gained popularity in both developed
and developing countries as an approach for harnessing economic growth to address environmental
issues
(Bina 2013; Georgeson et al. 2017; Capasso et al. 2019; Song et al. 2020; Hao et al. 2021)
. Critics
however a
rgue that green economy ultimately emphasises economic growth to the detriment of other
important aspects of human welfare such as social justice
(Adelman 2015; Death 2014; Kamuti 2015)
,
and challenge t
he central idea that it is possible to decouple economic activity and growth (measured
as GDP increment) from
increasing use of biophysical resources (raw materials, energy)
(Jackson and
Victor 2019; Parrique et al. 2019; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Haberl et al. 2020; Vadén et al. 2020)
.
Literature on degrowth, post growth, a
nd post development questions the sustainability and imperative
of more growth especially in already industrialised countries and argues that prosperity and the ‘Good
Life’ are not immutably tied to economic growth
(Escobar 2015; Asara et al. 2015; Kallis 2019;
Latouche 2018; see also
S
ection 5.2.1
in Chapter 5
)
.
T
he concept of
‘
just
transition
’
also stresses the
need to integrate justice concerns
so as to
not impose hardship on already marginalised populations
within and between countries
(Goddard and Farrelly 2018; Smith, Jackie and Patterson 2018;
McCauley and Heffron 2018; Evans and Phelan 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; see
section 1.7.2)
.
The key insight is that pursuing climate goals in the context of sustainable development requires holistic
thinking including on how to measure well
-
being, serious consideration of the notion of ecological
limits, at least some level of decoupling
and certainly choices and decision
-
making approaches that
exploit and maximise the synergy and minimises the trade
-
off between climate mitigation and other
sustainable development goals. It also requires consideration of equity and justice within and betw
een
countries. However,
ideas of a synergistic relationship between development and climate mitigation
can sometimes offer limited practical guidelines for reconciling the tensions that are often present in
practical policy making
(Dale et al. 2015b; Ferguson et al. 2014; Kasztelan 2017; Kotzé 2018)
.
1.6.3
Climate Mitigation, Equity
and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Climate action can be conceptualised as both a stand
-
alone and cross
-
cutting issue in the 2030
SDGs
(Makomere and Liti Mbeva 2018)
, given that
s
everal of the other goals such as ending poverty (Goal
1), zero hunger (Goal 2), g
ood health and wellbeing (Goal 3), affordable and clean energy (Goal 7)
among many others are related to climate change
(see Figure 3.39 in Chapter 3)
.
In addition to galvanising global collective action, the SDGs provide concrete themes, targets and
indi
cators for measuring human progress to sustainability
(Kanie and Biermann 2017
)
. The SDGs also
provide a basis for exploring the synergies and trade
-
offs between sustainable development and climate
change mitigation
(Makomere and Liti Mbeva 20
18; Mainali et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018;
Pradhan et al. 2017)
.
Progress to date
(Sachs et al. 2016)
shows fulfilling SDGs is a challenge for all
groups of countries
–
developed and developing
–
even though the challenge differs between countries
and regions
(Pra
dhan et al. 2017)
.
Historically, the industrialisation associated with economic development has involved a strong
relationship with GHG emissions
(
see Section 5.2.1 in Chapter 5
)
