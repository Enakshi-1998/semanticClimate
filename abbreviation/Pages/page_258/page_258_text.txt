economic and behavioural frameworks, as the greatest effects often involve
combining
behavioural
dimensions (e.g.
norms, social influence networ
ks, convenience and quality assurance
)
with financial
incentives and information
(Stern et al. 2010)
.
Randomised, controlled field trials
can help
predict the
effects of behavioural interventions
(Levitt and List 2009; McRae and Meeks 2016; Gillan 2017)
.
Chapter 5 explores both
positive and negative dimension
s of behaivour in more depth, including the
development of norms and interactions with the wider social context, with emphasis upon the services
associated with human wellbeing, rather than the economic activities per se.

political and institutional approaches
Political and institutional dynamics shape climate change responses in important ways, not least because
incumbent actors have frequently blocked climate policy (1.
4
.5). Institutional perspectives
probe
networ
ks of opposition
(Brulle 2019)
and
emphasise that their ability to
block
-
as well as the ability
of others to foster low carbon transitions
-
are structured by specific institutional forms across countries
(Lamb and Minx 2020)
. National institutions have widely been developed to promote traditionally
fossil
-
fuel based sectors like electricity and transport as key to economic development, contributing to
carbon lock
-
in
(Seto et al. 2016)
and inertia
(Rosenschöld et al. 2014)
.
The influence of interest groups on policy
-
making
varies across countries. Comparative political
economy approaches
tend to find that
countries where interests are closely coordinated by governments
(‘coordinated market economies’) have been able to generate transformative change more than those
with
a m
ore arms
-
length, even combative relationship between interest groups and governments
(‘liberal market economies’)
(Lachapelle and Paterson 2013; Meckling 2018; Ćetko
vić and Buzogány
2016; Zou et al. 2016)
. ‘Developmental states’ often have the capacity for strong intervention but any
low
-
carbon interventions may be overwhelmed by
other pressures and
very rapid economic growth
(Wood et al. 2020a)
.
Institutional features affecting
climate policy include levels and types of democracy
(Povitkina 2018)
,
electoral systems, or levels of institutional centralisation (federal vs unitary states, presidential vs
parliament
ary systems)
(Steurer and Clar 2018; Clulow 2019; Lachapelle and Paterson 2013)
. Countries
that
have constructed an overarching architecture of climate governance institutions (e.g. cross
-
department and multilevel coordination, and semi
-
autonomous climate agencies), are more able to
develop strategic approaches to climate governance needed to foster
transformative
change
(Dubash
2021)
.
Access of non

governmental organisations (
NGO
s)
to policy processes enables new ideas to be adopted,
but too close an NGO

government relation
may
stifle innovation and transformative action
(Dryzek et
al. 2003)
. NGO campaigns on fracking
(Neville et al. 2019)
or divestment
(Mangat et al. 2018)
have
raised attention to
ideas
such as
‘stranded assets’ in policy arenas
(Piggot 2018; Newell et al. 2020;
Paterson 2021; Green 2018)
.
Attempts to depoliticise climate change may
narrow the
space for
democratic participation and contestation, thus impacting
policy responses
(Swyngedouw 2010, 2011;
Kenis and Lievens 2014)
. Some institutional innovations have more directly targeted enhanced public
deliberation and participation, notably in citizens’ climate assem
blies
(Howarth et al. 2020)
and in the
use of legal institutions to litigate against those opposing climate action
(Peel and Osofksy 2020)
. This
literature shows that transformative pathways are possible within a variety of institutional settin
gs,
although institutional innovation will be necessary everywhere to pursue zero carbon transitions
; see
also Chapters 4 (
S
ection 4) and 13
.
Balancing
the
forces
outlined in
S
ection 4.6
in Chapter 4
typically involves building coalitions of actors
who benefit economically from climate policy
(Levin et al. 2012)
