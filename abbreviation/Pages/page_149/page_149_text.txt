Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be
achieved
relatively quickly, whereas CDR needs upfront investment. Sustainable intensification in agriculture,
shifting diets, and reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs,
and are therefore critical
for enabling supply

measures such as reforestation, restoration, as well as
decreasing CH

In addition, emerging technologies
(e.g., vaccines or
CH

nhibitors) have the potential to substantially increase
the
CH

po
tential beyond current estimates. AFOLU mitigation is not only relevant in countries with large land
areas. Many smaller countries and regions, particularly with wetlands, have disproportionately high
levels of AFOLU mitigation potential density. {7.4

}
The economic and political feasibility of implementing AFOLU mitigation measures is hampered
by persistent barriers. Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve significant
short
-
term
mitigation (
medium confidence
).
Finance forms a critical barrier to achieving these gains
as currently mitigation efforts rely principally on government sources and funding mechanisms which
do not provide sufficient resources to enable the economic potential to be realised. Differences i
n
cultural values, governance, accountability and institutional capacity are also important barriers.
Climate change

{WG
I Figure SPM7 and Sections 7.4 and 7.6}. The continued loss of biodiversity makes ecosystems
less resilient to climate change extremes and this may further jeopardise the achievement of the AFOLU
mitigation pot
entials indicated in this chapter (
high confidence
).

The provision of biomass for bioenergy (
with/without
BECCS) and other biobased products
represents an important share of the total mitigation potential associated with the AFOLU sector,
though these mitigation effects
accrue to
other
sectors
(

These potentials do not include avoided emissions resulting from bioenergy use associated with
BECCS, which depends on energy substitution patterns, conversion efficiencies, and supply
chain emissions for
both the BECCS and substituted energy systems. Estimates of substitution effects of bioenergy indicate that this
additional mitigation would be of the same magnitude as provided through CDR using BECCS. Biobased products
with long serv
ice life, e.g.,
construction timber, can also provide mitigation through substitution of steel, concrete,
and other products, and through carbon storage in the biobased product pool
. See section TS 5.7 for the
CDR
potential of BECCS
