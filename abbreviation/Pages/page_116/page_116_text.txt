Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
Declining energy intensity in almost all regions has been balanced by increased energy consumption.
{6.3}
The u
nit
costs
for several key energy system mitigation options
have dropped rapidly over the
last five years, notably solar PV, wind power, and batteries
(
high confidence
)
.
From 2015 to 2020,
the
costs
of electricity from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respecti
vely, and battery prices
dropped by 64%. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in
many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and
large
-
scale battery storage on e
lectricity grids is increasingly viable.

{6.3, 6.4}
Global wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased
rapidly
driven
by p
olicy,
societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions
(
high
confidence
)
.
Solar PV grew by 170% (to 680 TWh); wind grew
by 70%
(to 14
20
TWh) from 2015 to
2019.
Solar PV and wind
together
accounted for 21% of total low
-
carbon
electricity
generation
and
8%
of total electricity generation
in 2019
. Nuclear generation g
rew
9%
between 2015 and 2019 and
accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019
(2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by
10
%
and
accounted for 16% (42
9
0 TWh) of total generation
.
In total, low
-
and zero
-
carbon electricity generation
technologies produced 3
7%
of global electricity in 2019
. {6.3, 6.4}
If investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked
-
in to
higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to 2
°
C
or 1.5
°
C
(
high confidence
)
.
Many
aspects of the energy system
–
physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behavio
u
r
–
are resistant to change or take many years to change. New investments in coal
-
fired electricity without
CCS are inconsistent with limiting wa
rming to 2
°
C
or 1.5
°
C
. {6.3, 6.7}
Limiting warming to 2°C
or 1.5
°
C
will strand fossil
-
related assets, including fossil infrastructure
and unburned fossil fuel resources
(
high confidence
)
.
The economic impacts of stranded assets could
amount to trillions o
f dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets
are more vulnerable toward mid
-
century. CCS can allow fossil
fuels to be used longer, reducing
potential stranded assets.

: Stranded Assets
Limiting warming
to 2°C
or 1.5
°
C
is expected
to
result in the
“stranding” of carbon
-
intensive
assets.
Stranded assets can be broadly defined as assets which “suffer from unanticipated or premature
write
-
offs, downward revaluations or conv
ersion to liabilities”. Climate policies, other policies and
regulations, innovation in competing technologies, and shifts in fuel prices could all lead to stranded
assets. The loss of wealth from stranded assets would create risks for financial market
sta
bility,
reduce
fiscal revenue
for hydrocarbon dependent economies,
in turn
affecting
macro
-
economic stability
and the prospects for a just transition
.

Two
types of assets are at risk of being stranded: i)
in
-
ground fossil resources and ii) human
-
made
capital assets (e.g.
,
power plants, cars). About 30% of oil, 50% of gas, and 80% of coal reserves will
remain unburnable
if warming is limited to 2°C
.

Practically all
long
-
lived
technologies
and
investments
that cannot
be
adapted to low
-
carbon and zero
-
emission
modes could face stranding
under climate policy
–
depending on their current age and
expected lifetimes. Scenario evidence suggests that without carbon capture, the worldwide fleet of
c
oal
-
and gas power plants
would
need to retire about 23 and 17 years earlier
than expected lifetimes,
respectively
in order
to
limit global warming to
1.5°C and 2°C {2.7}.
