Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
literature
shows
that employment effect of mitigation policies tends to be limited on
aggregate but
can
be significant at sectoral level (
limited evidence, medium agreement
). Detailed design of mitigation
policies
is critical for distributional impacts and avoiding lock

(
high confidence

, though further
research is needed in that direction
.
{4.2.6}
The literature identifies a broad set of enabling conditions that can both foster
shifting
development pathways
and
accelerated
mitigation
(
medium evidence, high agreement
).
Policy
integration is a necessary component of shifting development pathways, addressing multiple objectives.
To this aim, mobilising a range of policies is preferable to single policy
instruments
(
high confidence
).
{4.4.1}. Governance for climate mitigat
ion and shifting development pathways is enhanced when
tailored to national and local contexts. Improved institutions and
effective
governance enable ambitious
action
on
climate and
can
help bridge implementation gaps (
medium evidence, high agreement
). Giv
en
that strengthening institutions may be a long
-
term endeavour, it needs attention in the near
-
term
{
4.4.1
}
.
Accelerated mitigation and shifting development pathways necessitates both re
-
directing existing
financial flows from high
-
to low
-
emissions techn
ologies and systems and to provide additional
resources to overcome current financial
barriers
(
high confidence
)
{4
.4.1}. Opportunities exist in the
near
-
term to close the finance gap
{
15.2.2
}
. At the national level, public finance for actions promoting
su
stainable development
helps broaden the scope of mitigation
(medium
confidence
)
.
Changes in
behaviour and lifestyles are important to move beyond mitigation as incremental change, and when
supporting shifts to more sustainable development pathways will broaden the scope of mitigation
(medium
confidence
)
.

Some enabli
ng conditions can be put in place relatively quickly while some others may take time
to
establish underscoring the importance of early action
(
high confidence
)
.
Depending on context,
some enabling conditions such as
such as promoting innovation
may take time to establish. Other
enabling conditions, such as improved access to financing, can be put in place in a relatively short time
frame, and can yield
rapid
results

ocusing on development pathways and considering how to shift them
may
also
yield rapid results
by providing
tools to accelerate mitigation and achieve other sustainable development
goals. {4.4.1}
.
Charting just transitions to net zero may provi
de a vision, which policy measures can
help achieve (Box TS.4, Box TS.8).
E
quity can be an important enabler
,
increas
ing
the level of
ambition for accelerated mitigation
(
high confidence
)
{4.5

.
Equity
deals with the
distribution of
costs and
benefits and how these are
shared
,
as per social contracts, national policy and international agreements. Transition pathways have
distributional consequences such as large changes in employment and economic structure
(
high
confidence
).
T
he
just transitio
n
concept has become an international focal point tying together social
movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low
-
carbon transitions
(
Box TS.

)
.
The e
ffectiveness of cooperative action and the perce
ption of fairness of
such arrangements are closely related in that pathways that prioritise equity and allow broad stakeholder
participation can enable broader consensus for the transformational change
impli
cit in
the need for
deeper mitigation (
robust evidence, medium agreement
)
.

: Just Transition
The
Just Transition
framework
refers to a set of principles, processes and practices aimed at ensuring
that no people, workers, places, sectors, countries or regions are left behind in the
move
from a high

carbon to a low
-
carbon economy. It includes respect and dignity for vulnerable g
roups; creation of
