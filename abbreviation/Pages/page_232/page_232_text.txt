risks and opportunities for the financial sector. The risks include physical risks related to the impacts of
climate change itself; transition risks related to the exposure
to policy, technology and behavioural changes
in line with a low
-
carbon transition; and liability risks from litigation for climate
-
related damages (Box
15.2). These could potentially lead to stranded assets (the loss of economic value of existing assets
before
the end of their useful lifetimes
(Bos and Gupta 2019
;
Section 6.7 in Chapter 6
,
Section
15.6.3
in Chapter

)
.
Such risks continue to be underestimated by financial institutions
(
Section
15
.6.1
in Chapter 15
)
. The
continuing expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and
insufficient
transparency on how these are valued
raises concerns that systemic risk may be accumu
lating in the financial sector in relation to a potential low
-
carbon transition that may already be under way
(Battiston et al. 2017;
Section
15.6.3
in Ch
apter 15
)

This is

"investors to reassess core assumptions” and may lead to “significant” capital reallocation

Climate

related investments in developing countries also suffer from structural barriers
such as sovereign risk and exchange rate volatility
(Farooquee and Shrimali 2016; Guzman et al. 2018)
which affect not only climate

related investment but investment in general
(Yamahaki et al. 2020)
including
in needed infrastructure development
(Gray and Irwin 2003)

T
here is often a disconnect between stated national climate
ambition and finance flows
, and
overseas direct
investment (ODI) from donor countries may be at odds with national climate pledges such as NDCs. One
report found funds supported by foreign State

Afr
ica in 2014
-
2017 went mostly to fossil fuel
-
based projects not strongly aligned with low
-
carbon
priorities of recipient countries’ NDCs
(Zhou et al. 2018)
. Similarly,
Steffen and Schmidt
(2019)
found that
even within Multilateral Development Banks, ‘public
-
and private
-
sector branches differ considerably’,
with public
-
sector lending used mainly in non
-
renewable and hydropower projects. Political leadership is
therefore essential to steer financial flows to
support low carbon transition (15.6).

identify significant mitigation potential if financing countries simply applied their own environmental
standards to their overseas investments.
