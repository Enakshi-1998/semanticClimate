though
some coun

Integrating analyses.
The response to COVID
-
19 also reflects the relevance of combining
multiple
analytic frameworks spanning economic efficiency, ethics and equity, transformation dynamics, and
psycho
logical and political
analyses
(Section
1.7
)
.
As
with climate impacts,
not only has the global burden
of disease been distributed unevenly,
but capabilities to prevent and treat disease were asymmetrical and
those in greatest vulnerability often had the least access to human, physical, and financial resources
(Ruger
and Horton 2020)
.
‘
G
reen’ versus ‘
b
rown’ reco
very has corresponding distributional consequences
between these and ‘green’ producers, suggesting need for differentiated policies with international
coordination
(Le Bi
llon et al. 2021)
. This
illustrates the role
of ‘
j
ust
t
ransition’ approaches
to global
responses including the value of inte
grated, multi
-
level governance (
Section
1.7
in this Chapter
,
Section
4.5
in Ch
apter 4 and Section

in Chapter 17
)
.
Crises and opportunities: the wider context for mitigation and transformation.
The impacts of
COVID
-
19 have been devastating in many ways, in many countries
, and may
distract political and financial
capacity away from efforts to mitigate
climate change. Yet, studies of previous post
-
shock periods suggest
that waves of innovation that are ready to emerge can be accelerated by crises, which may prompt new
behaviours, weaken incumbent (‘meso
-
level’) systems, and prompt
r
apid reforms
(
Section
1.6.5; Roberts
and Geels 2019a)
. Lessons from the collective effort to 'flatten the curve’ during the pandemic, illustrating
aspects of scienc
e
-
society interactions for public health in many countries, may carry over to climate
mitigation, and
open new opportunities (
Section
5.1.2
in Chapter 5
)
. COVID
-
19 appears to have accelerated
the emergence of renewable power, electromobility and
digitali
s
ation
(Newman 2020;
Sectiopn
5.1.2
in
Chapter 5
,
Section
6.3
in Chapter 6
,
Section
10.2
in Chapter 10
)
. Institutio
nal change is often very slow but
major economic dislocation can create significant opportunities for new ways of financing and enabling
‘leapfrogging’ investment to happen
(
Section
10.
8
in Chapter 10
)
. Given the unambiguous risks of climate
change, and co
nsequent stranded asset risks from new fossil fuel investments
(
Box 6.
11)
, the most robust
recoveries are likely to be those which emerge on lower carbon and resilient pathways
(Obergassel et al.
2020)
.
Noting the
critical global post
-
COVID
-
19 challenge as the double
-
impact of heightened credit risk
in developing count
ries, along with indebtedness in developed countries
,
(Hourcade et al. 2021a)
estimate
that a ‘multilateral’ sovereign guarantee structure to underwrite low carbon investment
s could leverage
projects up to
15
times its value, contribut
ing
to shifting development pathways consistent with the SDGs
and Paris goals.
COVID
-
19
can thus be taken as
a reminder of the urgency of addressing climate change,
a warning of the
risk of future
stranded assets (Rempel and Gupta
2021
; and Chapter
17
)
, but
also an opportunity for a
cleaner recovery.

CHAPTER BOX 1 HERE
In addition to developments
in climate science, emissions, the international agreements in 2015, and the
recent impact of COVID
-
19, a few other key developments have strong implications for climate mitigation.
