Diets high in plant protein
and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower GHG emissions
(
high
confidence
).
Ruminant meat shows the highest GHG intensity. Beef from dairy systems has lower
emissions intensity than beef from beef herds (8

when some emissions are allocated to dairy products. The wi
de variation in emissions reflects
differences in production systems, which range from intensive feedlots with stock raised largely on
grains through to rangeland and transhumance production systems. Where appropriate, a shift to diets
with a higher share
of plant protein,
moderate intake of animal

source foods and reduced intake of
saturated fats
could lead to substantial decreases in GHG emissions. Benefits would also include
reduced land occupation and nutrient losses to the surrounding environment, whil

providing health benefits and reducing mortality from diet

Emerging food technologies such as cellular fermentation, cultured meat, plant
-
based
alternatives to animal
-
based
food products, and controlled environment agriculture, can bring
substantial reduction in direct GHG emissions from food production
(limited evidence, high
agreement)
.
These technologies have lower land, water, and nutrient footprints, and address concerns
over animal welfare.
R
eali
s
ing
the full mitigation potential
depends on
a
ccess to low

carbon energy
as
some emerging technologies are relatively more energy intensive
. This also holds for deployment of
cold chain and packaging technologies, which can help reduce food loss and waste, but increase energy
and materials use in the food system
.
