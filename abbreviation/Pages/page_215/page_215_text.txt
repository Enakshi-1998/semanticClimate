experience of direct impacts, the IPCC has sought to systematise a robust approach to risk and risk
management.
In AR6 the IPCC employs a common risk framing across all three working group
s and provides
guidance for more consistent and transparent usage (
AR6
WGI Cross

Chapter Box 3
in Chapter 1
; AR6
WGII 1.4.1; IPCC risk guidance
). AR6 defines risk as
“
the potential for adverse consequences for
human or ecological systems,
recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such
systems
”
(
Annex I
)
, encompassing r
isks from
both
potential impacts of climate change
and
human
responses
to it
(Reisinger et al. 2020)
.
The risk fr
aming includes steps for identifying, evaluating, and
prioritising current and future risks; for understanding the interactions among different sources of risk;
for
distributing
effort and equitable sharing of risks; for monitoring and adjusting actions ov
er time
while continuing to assess changing circumstances; and for communications among analysts, decision
-
makers, and the public.
Climate change risk assessments face challenges including a tendency to mis
-
characterise risks and pay
insufficient attention
to the potential for surprises
(Weitzman 2011; Aven and Renn 2015; Stoerk et al.
2018)
. Concepts of resilience and vulnerability provide overlapping, alternative entry points t
o
understanding and addressing the societal challenges caused and exacerbated by climate change (AR6,
WGII, Chap
ter
1.2.1).
AR6 WGII devotes a full chapter (17) to ‘
Decision

Making Options for Managing Risk
’,
detailing the
analytic approaches and
drawing upon the
Cynefin
classification of Known, Knowable, Complex and
Chaotic systems
(17.3.1)
.
With deep uncertainty, risk management often aims to identify specific
combinations of response actions and enabling ins
titutions that increase the potential for favourable
outcomes despite irreducible uncertainties

Literature trying to quantify the cost of climate damages has continue

methodologies systematically affect outcomes, with recent estimates based on empirical approaches

econometric measurements based on actual impacts

‘categorically higher than estimates from other

Simultaneously, the literature increasingly emphasises the importance of multi

assessment and management (e.g., representative key risks in WGII
Chapter

not corr

The Multilateral Context

Emission Trends
and Key Developments
Since AR5, there have been notable multilateral efforts which help determine the context for current
and future climate action. This section summarises key features of this
evolving context.

T
he 2015 Agreements
In 2015 the world concluded four major agreements that are very relevant to climate action. These
include: the Paris Agreement under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
