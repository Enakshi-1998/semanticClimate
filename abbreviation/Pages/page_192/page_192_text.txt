Note that, demand pull
instruments in the regulatory instrument category, for instance,
can also shape the early stages of the innovation process. Their position on the latter stages is highlighted in this
figure just because typically these instruments have been introduced in l
atter stages of the development of the
technology. {16.4.4}
Experience and analyses show that technological change is inhibited if technological innovation
system functions are not adequately fulfilled
;
this inhibition occurs more often in developing

(high confidence)
.
Examples of such functions are knowledge development, resource
mobilisation, and activities that shape the needs, requirements and expectations of actors within the
innovation system (guidance of the search). Capabilities play a key
role in these functions, the build

up
of which can be enhanced by domestic measures, but also by international cooperation. For instance,
innovation cooperation on wind energy has contributed to the accelerated global spread of this
technology. As another
example, the policy guidance by the Indian government, which also promoted
development of data, testing capabilities and knowledge within the private sector, has been a key
determinant of the success of an energy

efficiency programme for air conditioners
and refrigerators in
India. {

Consistent with innovation system approaches, the sharing of knowledge and experiences
between developed and developing countries can contribute to addressing glob
al climate and
the
SDGs
. The
effectiveness of such international cooperation arrangements, however, depends on
the way they are developed and implemented
(
high confidence
)
. The effectiveness and sustainable
development benefits of technology sharing under
market conditions appears to be determined primarily
by the complexity of technologies, local capabilities and the policy regime. This suggests that the
development of planning and innovation capabilities remains necessary, especially in least
-
developed
co
untries and SIDS. International diffusion of low
-
emission technologies is also facilitated by
knowledge spill
overs from regions engaged in clean R&D (
medium confidence
).

The evidence on the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in innovation is mixed. Some
literature suggests that it is a barrier while other sources suggests that it is an enabler to the
diffusion of climate

Th

with well

developed institutional capacity may benefit from a strengthened IPR regime, but that
