The
Working Group III (WG III) contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) assesses

on the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and social
aspects of
climate change

The report
assesses
new literature
,
methodological and
recent
developments
,
and changes in approaches
to
wards
climate change mitigation since the
IPCC
AR5
report
was
published
in 2014
.
The global
science and policy landscape on
climate change mitigation has evolved
since AR5. The
development of the literature reflects, among other factors, the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), the outcomes of its Kyoto Protocol and the
goals of the Paris Agreement {13, 14,
15}, and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development {1, 4, 17}. Literature further highlights the
growing role of non
-
state and sub
-
national actors
in the global effort to address climate change
,
including
cities, businesses, citizens, transnational initiatives and public
-
private entities {
5,
8, 13}. It
draws attention to the decreasing cost of some low emission technologies {2, 6, 12} and the evolving
role of international cooperation {14}, finance {15} an
d innovation {16}.
E
merging literature
examines
the global spread of climate policies,
strengthe
ned
mitigation actions
in
developing countries
,
sustained
reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
in some
d
e
v
eloped
countries
and
the continuing
challenges
for mitigation
.
{2, 13}
There are ever closer
linkages between climate change mitigation, development pathways and the
pursuit of sustainable development goals. Development pathways largely drive GHG emissions and
hence shape the mitigation challenge and
the portfolio of available responses
{4}
.
The co
-
benefits and
risks of mitigation responses
also
differ according to stages of development and national capabilities
{1, 2, 3, 4, 13}. Climate change mitigation framed in the context of sustainable development, equity,
and poverty eradication, and rooted in the development aspirations of the society wit
hin which they
take place, will be more acceptable, durable and effective

This report includes new assessment
approaches
that go beyond those evaluated in the previous IPCC
WG III reports
. In addition to sectoral and systems chapters {6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11},
th
is
report includes, for
the first time, chapters dedicated to
cross
-
sectoral perspectives {12}
demand, services and social aspects
of mitigation
(

and innovation, technology development and transfer
{16}
.
The
assessment of future pathways combines a

with
an assessment of
