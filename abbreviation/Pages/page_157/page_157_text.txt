Implementation strategies need to reflect that CDR methods differ in terms of removal

CDR governance and policymaking can draw on widespread experience with emissions reduction
measures
(

.
Additionally
, to accelerate research, development, and demonstration,
and to incentivise CDR deployment, a political commitment to formal integration into existing climate
policy frameworks is required, including reliable
measurement
, reporting and verification MRV of
carbon flows.

: Carbon Dioxide Removal
Carbon Dioxide Removal (
CDR
)
is necessary to achieve net
zero CO
2
and GHG emissions both globally
and nationally, counterbalancing ‘hard
-
to
-
abate’ residual emissions. CDR is also an essential element
of scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C or
likely
below 2°C by 2100, regardless of whether global
emissions reach near
z
ero, net
zero or net
negative levels. While national mitigation portfolios aiming
at net
zero emissions or lower will need to include some level of CDR, the choice of methods and the
scale and timing of their deployment will depend on the achievement of gr
oss emission reductions, and
managing multiple sustainability and feasibility constraints, including political preferences and social
acceptability.
CDR refers to anthropogenic activities
removing
CO
2
from the
atmosphere
and durably storing it in
geologica
l
,
terrestrial
, or
ocean
reservoirs, or in products. It includes
existing and potential
anthropogenic enhancement of biological, geochemical or chemical CO
2
sinks, but excludes natural
CO
