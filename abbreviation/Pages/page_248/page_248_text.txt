Sustainable development pathways towards fulfilling the SDGs

The graph shows
global average
per capita GHG emissions
(vertical axis)
and
relative
"Historic Index of
Human Development" (HIHD) levels
(horizonal)
have increased globally since the industrial revolution
(grey line). The bubbles on the graph show regional per capita GHG emissions and human development
levels in the year 2015
, illustrating
large disparities
.
P
ath
ways
towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement
(
and SDG 13
)
involve
global

per capita GHG emissions
below about 5

e
by
2030. Likewise,
to fulfil SDGs 3, 4 and 8, HIHD levels
(see footnote 7)
need to be at least 0.5 or greater.
This suggests
a
‘
sustainable development zone
’
for year 2030 (in green)
; the in
-
figure text also suggests a
sustainable
development corridor, where countries limit per capita GHG emissions while improving levels of huma
n
development over time. The
emphasis of pathways
into
the
sustainable development zone differ (
green
arrows) but in each case transformations are needed in how human development is attained while
limiting GHG emissions.
