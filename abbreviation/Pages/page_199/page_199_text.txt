improvements, red values to proportional worsening. Note: only the left panel considers climate impacts on
sustainable development; the mi

The feasibility of deploying response options is shaped by barriers and enabling conditions across
geophysical, environmental
-
ecological, technological, economic, socio
-
cultural, and institutional
dimensions
(
high confidence
)
.
Accelerating t
he deployment o
f response options depends on reducing
or removing barriers
across these dimensions, as well
on establishing and strengthening enabling
conditions. Feasibility is context
-
dependent, and also depends on the scale and the speed of
implementation. For example
:
the institutional, legal and administrative capacity to support deployment
varies across countries;
the feasibility of options that involve large
-
scale land use changes is highly
context dependent; spatial planning has a higher potential in early stages
of urban development; the
geophysical potential of geothermal is site specific; and cultural and local conditions may either inhibit
or enable demand
-
side responses.

a broad range of secto
r specific, and cross sectoral response options
