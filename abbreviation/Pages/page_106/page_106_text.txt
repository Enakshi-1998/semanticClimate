Values in the table refer to the 50th and (5th
-
95th) percentile values. For emissions
-
related
columns this relates to the distribution of all the pathways in that category. For Temperature Change and
Likelihood columns, single upper row
values are the 50th percentile value across pathways in that Category for
the MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges, the median warming for every pathway in that
category is calculated for each of the three climate model emulators (MAGICC
, FaIR and CICERO
-
SCM).
Subsequently, the 5th and 95th percentile values across all pathways is calculated. The coolest and warmest
outcomes (i.e. the lowest p5 of three emulators, and the highest p95, respectively) are shown in the brackets. Thus
these ra
nges cover the extent of pathway and climate model emulator uncertainty.

Category definitions consider at

peak warming and warming at the end

century (2100).
C1: Below 1.5°C in 2100 with a greater than 50% probability and a peak warming higher than 1.
5°C with less
than 67% probability.
C2: Below 1.5°C in 2100 with a greater than 50% probability but peak warming higher than 1.5°C with a
probability of 67% or greater.
C3:
Likely
below 2 °C throughout the century with a probability of 67% or greater.
C4,
C5, C6, C7: Below 2 °C, 2.5 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C throughout the century, respectively, with greater than 50%
probability.
C8: Peak warming above 4 °C with greater than 50% probability.

The warming profile of t

-
Neg peaks around 2060 and declines to below 1.5
°C
(50% likelihood) shortly
after 2100. Whilst technically classified as a C3, it strongly exhibits the characteristics of C2 high overshoot
pathways, hence it is placed under C2 category.

C3 pathways
are sub
-
categorized according to policy ambition and consistent with Figure SPM 6. Two pathways
derived from a cost
-
benefit analysis have been added to C3a, whilst 10 pathways with specifically designed near
-
term action until 2030 that fall below or above
NDCs levels are not included in either of the two subclasses.

Percentage GHG reduction ranges shown here are calculated relative to the modelled 2019 emissions based on
the harmonized and infilled projections from the models (Annex III, section II.2.5).
Negative values (e.g. in C7,
C8) represent an increase in emissions.
6
Percentage (%) reductions and emissions milestones are based on model data for CO
2
& GHG emissions, which
has been harmonized to 2015 values. See also Footnote 9.

The first year rang
e refers to the five year period within which the median peak emissions year or net zero year
falls. The second year range refers to the full range (rounded to the nearest five years) within which the 5
th
and
95
th
percentiles fall.
8
Percentiles reported a
cross all pathways in that category including pathways that do not reach net zero before
2100 (fraction of pathways reaching net zero is given in square brackets). If the fraction of pathways that reach
net zero before 2100 is lower than the fraction of pa
thways covered by a percentile (e.g. 0.95 for the 95th
percentile), the percentile is not defined and denoted with "…". Fraction of pathways reaching net zero is
calculated based on the native model emissions profiles.

For cases where models do not repor
t all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and calculated as Kyoto
basket in CO2

eq using AR6 GWP100. For each pathway, a minimum of native reporting of CO

emissions was required for the assessment of the climate response and assignment to
a climate category. Emissions
pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. See Annex III for details.

For better comparability with the WG
I assessment of the remaining carbon budget, the cumulative GHG
emissions o
f the pathways are harmonized to the 2015 CO
2
emissions levels used in the WG
I assessment and are
calculated for the future starting in 1 January 2020.

Temperature change (Global Surface Air Temperature
-
GSAT) for category (at peak and in 2100), based
on
the median warming for each pathway assessed using the probabilistic climate model emulators.
12
Probability of staying below the temperature thresholds for the pathways in each category, taking into
consideration the range of uncertainty from the
climate model emulators consistent with the WG
I AR6
assessment. The probabilities refer to the probability at peak temperature. Note that in the case of temperature
overshoot (E.g., category C2 and some pathways in C1), the probabilities at the end of the
century are higher than
the probability at peak temperature.
