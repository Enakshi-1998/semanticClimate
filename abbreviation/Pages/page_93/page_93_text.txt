Studies evaluating up to 105 updated NDCs

with conditional

closes the emission gaps by about one

A
n
implementation gap
also
exists between the
projected
emissions with
‘current policies’ and the projected emissions resulting from the
implementation of the unconditional and conditional elements of NDCs
; this is
estimated to be around
4 and 7 GtCO

Many
countries
would therefore
require
additional policies and associated
action
on
climate
change
to meet their autonomously
determined mitigation targets
as specified under the first NDCs (
limited evidence
).
The disruptions
triggered by the COVID
-
19
pandemic
increase uncertainty over
the
range of projections relative to pre
-
COVID
-
19 literature. As indicated by a growing number of studies at the national an
d global level, how
large near
-
to mid
-
term emissions implications of the COVID
-
19 pandemic are, to a large degree
depends on how stimulus or recovery packages are designed
