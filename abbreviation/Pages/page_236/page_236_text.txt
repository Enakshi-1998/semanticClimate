Chapter 13 charts
the international
evolution
of policies
and many of the lessons drawn. Attributing the
overall i
mpact on emissions is complex, but an emerging literature of
several hundred
papers indicates
impacts on multiple drivers of emissions

.
This suggests initial evidence that policy has driven some decoupling (
e.g.
Figure 1.1d) and started to ‘bend
the curve’ of global emissions
, but more specific attribution to observed trends is not as yet possible
.

However
,
some policies (
e.g.
subsidies to fossil fuel production or consumption), increase emissions; whilst
othe
rs (
e.g.
investment protection) may constrain efforts at mitigation. Also, wider economic and
developmental policies have important direct and indirect impacts on emissions. Policy is
thus
both a driver
and a constraint on mitigation.
Synergies and trade
-
offs arise partly because of the nexus of GHG emissions with other adverse impacts
(e.g. local air pollution) and critical resources (e.g. water and food)
(Conway et al. 2015; Andrews

and Dalin 2017)
,
which also imply interacting policy domains.
The literature shows increasing emphasis on policy packages, including those spanning the different levels

OOTNOTE

Linking estimated policy impacts to trends is complex, and as yet very tentative. An important factor
is that many mitigation policies involve investments in low carbon or energy efficient technology, the savings from
which persist. As a purely illustrati
ve example: the annual increase in global emissions during 2000
-
2010 averaged
around 1GtCO

e

, but with large fluctuations. If policies by 2010 reduced the
annual increase
in that year by
100MtCO
2
e (0.1GtC0
2
e) below what it would otherwise have been,
this is hard to discern. But if these savings sustain,
and in each subsequent year, policies cut another 100MtCO
2
e off the annual increase compared to the previous year,
global emissions after a decade would be around 5GtCO

below what they would
have been without any such
policies, and on average close to stabilising. However each step would be difficult to discern in the noise of annual
fluctuations.
