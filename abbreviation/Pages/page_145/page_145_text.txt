eliminating the limestone calcination process emissions for making clinker, which currently represent
60% of GHG emissions in best available
technology plants. {11.3.2, 11.3.6, 11.4.1.2}
While several technological options exist for
decarbonizing the main industrial feedstock
chemicals and their derivatives, the costs vary widely
(high confidence).
Fossil fuel
-
based
feedstocks are inexpensive a
nd still without carbon pricing, and their biomass
-
and electricity
-
based
replacements
are expected to
be more expensive. The chemical industry consumes large amounts of
hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, carbon monoxide, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, a
nd mixed
xylenes & aromatics from fossil feedstock, and from these basic chemicals produces tens of thousands
of derivative end
-
use chemicals. Hydrogen, biogenic or air
-
capture carbon, and collected
plastic waste
for the primary feedstocks can greatly redu
ce total emissions. Biogenic carbon feedstock is
expected
to
be limited due to competing land
-
uses. {11.4.1}
Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through switching to low GHG
fuels (e.g., biofuels
and hydrogen) and electricity (e.g.
, for electrothermal heating and heat
pumps)
(high confidence).
Most of these technologies are already mature, for example for low
temperature heat, but a major challenge is the current low cost of fossil
CH
4
and coal relative to low and
zero GHG electrici
ty, hydrogen, and biofuels. {11.4.1}
The pulp and paper industry has significant biogenic carbon emissions but relatively small fossil
carbon emissions. Pulp mills have access to biomass residues and by
-
products
and in paper mills
the use of process heat a
t low to medium temperatures allows for electrification
(high confidence)
.
Competition for feedstock will increase if wood substitutes for building materials and petrochemicals
feedstock. The pulp and paper industry can also be a source of biogenic carbon
dioxide
,
carbon for
organic chemicals feedstock
,
and
for
CDR using CCS. {11.4.1}
The geographical distribution of renewable resources has implications for
industry
(medium
confidence)
.
The potential for zero emission electricity and low
-
cost hydrogen from electrolysis
powered by solar and wind, or hydrogen from other very low emission sources, may reshape where
currently energy and emissions intensive basic materials production is locate
d, how value chains are
organized, trade patterns, and what gets transported in international shipping. Regions with bountiful
solar and wind resources, or low fugitive
CH
4
co
-
located with CCS geology, may become exporters of
hydrogen or hydrogen carriers
such as methanol and ammonia, or home to the production of iron and
steel, organic platform chemicals, and other energy intensive basic materials. {11.2

The level of
policy maturity and experience varies widely across the mitigation option
s
(high
confidence)
.
Energy efficiency is a well
-
established policy field with decades of experience from
voluntary and negotiated agreements, regulations, energy auditing and demand side
-
management
(DSM) programs. In contrast, materials demand management
and efficiency are not well understood
and addressed from a policy perspective. Barriers to recycling that policy could address are often
specific to the different material loops (e.g., copper contamination for steel and lack of technologies or
poor econom
ics for plastics) or waste management systems. For electrification and fuel switching the
focus has so far been mainly on innovation and developing technical supply
-
side solutions rather than
creating market demand. {11.5.2, 11.6}
Industry has so far large
ly been sheltered from the impacts of climate policy an
d carbon pricing
due to concerns
about
carbon leakage
18
and reducing
competitiveness
(high confidence)
.
New
approaches
to
industrial development policy
are emerging
for a transition to net zero GHG
emissions.
The transition requires a clear direction towards net
zero, technology development, market demand for
low

carbon materials and products, governance capacity and learning, socially inclusive phase

plans, as well as international coordination
of climate and trade policies
