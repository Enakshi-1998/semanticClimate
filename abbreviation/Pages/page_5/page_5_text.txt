the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land
are defined. Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the
limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and
completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently
preferable. Even when the same methodological approach is applied, the large uncertainty of CO
2
-
LULUCF emissions can lead to substantial revisions to estimated emissions. {Cross-Chapter Box 3 in

B.1.3
Historical cumulative net CO
2
emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400±240 GtCO
2
(
high
confidence
). Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400±195 GtCO
2
], and
about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000±90 GtCO
2
]. About 17% of historical cumulative net CO
2
emissions since 1850 occurred between 2010 and 2019 [410±30 GtCO
2
]. [FOOTNOTE 10] By
comparison, the current central estimate of the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards for limiting
warming to 1.5°C with a probability of 50% has been assessed as 500 Gt CO
2
, and as 1150 Gt CO
2
for
a probability of 67% for limiting warming to 2°C. Remaining carbon budgets depend on the amount of
non-CO
2
mitigation (±220 Gt CO
2
) and are further subject to geophysical uncertainties. Based on central
estimates only, cumulative net CO
2
emissions between 2010-2019 compare to about four fifths of the
size of the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards for a 50% probability of limiting global
warming to 1.5°C, and about one third of the remaining carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit
global warming to 2°C. Even when taking uncertainties into account, historical emissions between 1850
and 2019 constitute a large share of total carbon budgets for these global warming levels [FOOTNOTE
11, 12]. Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO
2
emissions between 1850-2019
amount to about four fifths [FOOTNOTE 12] of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting
global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO
2
), and to about two thirds [FOOTNOTE
12] of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate
about 3550 GtCO
2
). {Figure 2.7, 2.2, Figure TS.3, WG I Table SPM.2}
FOOTNOTE 10:
For consistency with WGI, historical cumulative CO
2
emissions from 1850-2019 are
reported using 68% confidence intervals.
FOOTNOTE 11:
The carbon budget is the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic
CO
2
emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given likelihood,
taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the total
carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon
budget when expressed from a recent specified date. The total carbon budgets reported here are the sum
of historical emissions from 1850 to 2019 and the remaining carbon budgets from 2020 onwards, which
extend until global net zero CO
2
emissions are reached. {Annex I: Glossary; WG I SPM}
FOOTNOTE 12:
Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the
specific calculated fractions.
B.1.4
Emissions of CO
2
–FFI dropped temporarily in the first half of 2020 due to responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic (
high confidence
), but rebounded by the end of the year (
medium confidence
).
The annual average CO
2
-FFI emissions reduction in 2020 relative to 2019 was about 5.8% [5.1-6.3%],
or 2.2 [1.9-2.4] GtCO
2
(
high confidence
). The full GHG emissions impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
could not be assessed due to a lack of data regarding non-CO
2
GHG emissions in 2020. {Cross-Chapter
