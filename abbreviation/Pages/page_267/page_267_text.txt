frameworks for analysing
transition and transformation
across multiple sectors need to draw on both
socio
-
technical transition literatures, and those on social transformation. Finally, literatures on
psychology, behaviour and political sciences
can illuminate obstacles that have impeded progress to
date, and suggest ways to overcome them.
No single analytical framework, or single discipline, on its own can offer a comprehensive assessment
of climate change mitigation. Together they point to the relevance of growing literatures and discourses
on ‘just transitions’, and the role of governance
at multiple levels. Ultimately all these frameworks are
needed to inform the decisions required to deepen and connect the scattered elements of progress to
date, and hence accelerate progress towards agreed goals and multiple dimensions of climate
change
mitigation in the context of sustainable development.

Knowledge gaps
Despite huge expansion in the literature
(Callaghan et al. 2020)
, knowledge gaps remai
n
.
Modeling
still
struggles to bring together detailed physical and economic climate impacts
and mitigation, with limited
represent
ation of
financial and distributional dynamics.
T
here are few interdisciplinary tools
which
apply theories of transition and
transformation to questions of economic and social impacts
,
compounded by remaining uncertainties concerning
the role of new technological sets, international
instruments, policy and political evaluation
.
One scan of
future research
needs
suggests
three
pr
iority
areas
(Roberts et al.
2020)
; 1. Human welfare
focused development (e.g. reducing inequality), 2.
How
the historic position of states within
international power relations conditions their ability to respond to climate change, 3.
Transition
dynamics and the flexibility of inst
itutions to drive towards low carbon development pathways.
There
remain
gap
s
in understanding
how international dynamics
and
agreements filter down to affect
constituencies and local implementation.
Literature on the potential for supply side agreement
s
, i
n
which producers agree to restrict the supply of fossil fuels
(e.g. Asheim et al. 2019)
is limited but gaining
increasing academic attention.
Nature is under pressure both at land and at sea as demonstrated by
declining biodiversity
(IPBES
2019)
. Climate policies could increase the pressure on land and oceans
(see IPCC 2019c,b)
,
with
in
sufficient attention to relationships between biodiversity and climate agreements and
associated
policies
. IPBES
aims
to coordinate with the IPCC more directly, but literature will be required to
support these reports.
Compounding these gaps is the fact t

socially oriented,

, where human and
non

human systems intersect most obviously,
remain under

(e.g. Balasubramanya and Stifel
2020)
.
Efforts to engage with policies here, especially framed around ecosystem services, have often
neglected their “practical fitness” in favor of focusing on their “institutional fitness”
, which
needs to be
addressed
in future research
(Stevenson et al. 2021)
.
The relative roles of short

term
mitigation
policies and
long
-
term investments, including government
and financial decision

making tools, remains inadequately explored. Strategic investments may include
city planning, public transport, EV charging networks,
and
CCU/
CCS.
Understanding how
international
treaties
c
an
increase incentives to make such investments is all the more salient in the aftermath of
COVID

, on which research is necessarily young but rapidly growing. Finally, the economic,
institutional and political strategies to close the gap between NDCs, a
ctual implementation, and
mitigation goals
–
informed
by the
PA
and
the UNFCCC Global Stocktake
–
require much further
research.
