measuring and monitoring action towards a global goal
(Milkoreit and Haapala 2019)
.
International
cooperation (including the UNFCCC)
can also promote technology deve
lopment and transfer
and
capacity
building; mobilise finance for mitigation and adaptation, and
help
address
concerns on
climate justice
(Chan
et al. 2018; Okereke and Coventry 2016; see Chapters 14
-
16)
.
A common criticism of international institutions is their limited (if any) powers to enforce
compliance
(Zahar 2017)
.
As a global legal institution, the
PA has little enforcement mechanism
(Si
ndico 2015)
, but
enforcement is not a necessary condition for an instrument to be legally binding
(Bodansky 2016; Rajamani
2016)
. In reality implementation
of specific commitments
tends to be high once countries have ratified and
a Treaty or an Agreement is in force
(Bodansky 2016; Rajamani 2016)
.
Often, the problem is not so much
of 'power to enforce compliance or sanction non
-
compliance', but the level of ambition
(
Chapter 14
)
.
However,
whilst in most respects a driver,
international cooperation
has also
be
en
characterised
as
‘organised hypocrisy
’ where proclamations are not matched with corresponding action
(Egnell 2010)
.
Various reasons for inadequate progress after 30 years of climate negotiations, have been identified
(Stoddard et al. 2021)
.
International cooperation can also seem to be a barrier to ambitious action when
negotiation is trapped in
‘
relative
-
gains
’
calculus
,
se
ek
to game the regime or gain leverage over one
another
(Purdon 2017)
,
or
where states
low
er ambition to
the
‘
least common dominator
’
to accommodate
participation of the least ambitious states
(Falkner 2016)
.
Geden
(2016)
and
Dubash
(2020)
offer more
nuanced assessments
.
I
nternational collaboration works best
if an
agreement
can be made
self
-
reinforcing with incentives for
mutual gains and joint action
(Keohane and Victor 2016; Barrett 2016)
, but
the structure of the climate
challenge makes
this
hard to achieve.
The evidence from the Montreal Protocol on ozone depleting
substances and from the Kyoto Protocol on GH
Gs, is that legally binding targets have been
effective
in that
participating Parties complied with them
(Albrecht and Parker 2019; Shishlov et al. 2016)
, and (for Kyoto)
these account for most of the countries that have sustained emission reductions for at least the past 10
-
15
years (
S
ection
1.3.2;
Section
2.
2
in Chapter 2
). However, such binding commitments may deter
parti
cipation
if
there are no clear incentives to sustain participation
and especially if other growing emitters
are omitted by design
,
as with the Kyoto Protocol. Consequently the US refused to ratify (and Canada
withdrew), particularly on the grounds that developing countries had no targets; with participation in
Kyoto’s second period commitments declining further, the net result was lim
ited global progress in
emissions under Kyoto
(Scavenius and Rayner 2018; Bodansky 2016; Okereke and Coventry 2016)
despite
full legal compliance in both commitment periods (chapter 14).
The ne
gotiation of
the Paris Agreement
was thus done in the context of serious questions about how best
to structure international climate cooperation to achieve better results. This new agreement is designed to
side
-
step the fractious bargaining which character
ised international climate cooperation
(Marcu 2017)
.
It
contains a mix of hard, soft and non
-
obligations, the boundaries between which are blurred, but each of
which plays a distinct and valuable role
(Rajamani 2016)
.
The provisions of the
PA
could encourage flexible
responses to changing conditions
,
but
limit assurance
s
of
ambitious
national
commitments and their
fulfilment
(Pickering et al. 2018)
.
T
he extent to which this new arrangement will drive ambitious climate
policy in the long run remains to be seen (Chapter 14).
Whilst the PA abandoned common accounting systems and timeframes, o
utside the UNFCCC many other
platforms and metrics for comparing mitigation efforts have emerged
(Aldy 2015)
. Countries may assess
others’ efforts in
determining their actions through
multiple
platforms
including
