Sustainable development pathways towards fulfilling the S

Figure TS.1 legend:
The graph shows how global average per capita GHG emissions (vertical axis) and relati
ve
"Historic Index of Human Development" (HIHD) levels (horizonal axis) have increased globally since the
industrial revolution (grey line). The bubbles on the graph show regional per capita GHG emissions and human
development levels in the year 2015, illust
rating large disparities. Pathways towards fulfilling the Paris
Agreement
and SDG 13
(Climate Action) involve global average per capita GHG emissions below
around
5
tCO

eq by 2030. Likewise,
HIHD levels need to be at least 0.5 or greater
to fulfil SDGs 3
(

,
SDG
4
(Quality Education)
and
SDG
8
(Decent Work & Economic Growth)
. This suggests a
‘sustainable development zone’ for year 2030 (in green); the in
-
figure text also suggests a
sustainable
development corridor
, where countries limit per capita GHG emissions while improving levels of human
development over time. The empha
sis of pathways into the sustainable development zone differ (green arrows)
but in each case transformations are needed in how human development is attained while limiting GHG
emissions.

The transition to a low carbon economy depends on a wid
e range of closely intertwined drivers
and constraints, including policies and technologies where notable advances over the past decade
have opened up new and large

scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative
