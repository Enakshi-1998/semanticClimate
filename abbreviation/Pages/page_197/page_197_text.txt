Mitigation options have synergies with many Sustainable Development Goals, but there are
trade

offs associated with some options especially when implemented at scale. The
synergies and trade

offs vary widely and depend on the context

Figure

presents a summary of the chapter

level
qualitative assessment of the
synergies and trade
-
offs
for selected mitigation options. Overlaps may exist in the mit
igation options assessed
and presented by sector and system, and interlinkages with the SDGs might differ depending on the application
of that option by sector.
Interactions of mitigation options with the SDGs are context
-
specific and dependent on
the scal
e of implementation.
For some mitigation options, these scaling and context
-
specific issues imply that
there are both synergies and trade
-
offs in relation to specific SDGs.
The SDGs are displayed as coloured
