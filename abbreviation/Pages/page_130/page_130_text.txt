Transport
Meeting climate mitigation goals would require transformative changes in the transport sector.
In 2019,
direct
GHG
emissions from the
transport sector
were
8.7 GtCO
2
-
eq (up from 5.0 GtCO
2
-
eq in
1990) and
accounted for 23% of global energy
-
related CO
2
emissions.
70
% of
direct
transport emissions
came from road vehicles, while 1%,
11
%, and
1
2
%
came from rail, shipping, and aviation, respectively.
Emissions from shipping and aviation continue to grow rapidly.
Transport
-
related emissions in
developing regions of the world have increased more rapidly than in Europe or North America, a trend
that is
expected
to continue in coming decades

Since AR5 there has been a
growing awareness of the need for demand management solutions
combined with new technologies, such as the rapidly growing use of electromobility for land
transport and the emerging options in advanced biofuels and hydrogen
-
based fuels for shipping
and avia
tion
and in other specific land
-
based contexts
(
high confidence)
.
There is a growing need
for systemic infrastructure changes that enable behavioural modifications and reductions in demand for
transport services that can in turn reduce energy demand. The r
esponse to the COVID
-
19 pandemic has
also shown that behavioural interventions can reduce transport
-
related GHG emissions. For example,
COVID
-
19
-
based lockdowns have confirmed the transformative value of telecommuting replacing
significant numbers of work
and personal journeys as well as promoting local active transport. There
are growing opportunities to implement strategies that drive behavioural change and support the
adoption of new transport technology options. {

Chang
es in urban form, behaviour programs, the circular economy, the shared economy, and
digitalisation trends can support systemic changes that lead to reductions in demand for transport
services or expands the use of more efficient transport
modes (
high confi
dence
).
Cities can reduce
their transport
-
related fuel consumption by around 25% through combinations of more compact land
use and the provision of less car
-
dependent transport infrastructure. Appropriate infrastructure,
including protected pedestrian and
bike pathways, can also support much greater localised active
travel
.

Transport demand management incentives are expected to be necessary to support these
systemic changes. There is mixed evidence of the effect of circular economy initiatives, shared eco
nomy
initiatives, and digitalisation on demand for transport services
(
Box TS.1
4
)
. For example, while
dematerialisation can reduce the amount of material that need
s
to be transported to manufacturing
facilities, an increase in online shopping with priority
delivery can increase demand for freight transport.
Similarly, while teleworking could reduce travel demand, increased ridesharing could increase vehicle
-
km travelled

Battery
-
electric vehicles (BEVs) have lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions than internal
combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) when BEVs are charged with low carbon electricity
(
high
confidence
).
Electromobility is being rapidly implemented in micro
-
mobi
lity (e
-
autorickshaws, e
-
scooters, e
-
bikes), in transit systems, especially buses, and to a lesser degree, in personal vehicles. BEVs
could also have the added benefit of supporting grid operations. The commercial availability of mature
l
ithium
-
i
on
b
atteri
es (LIBs) has underpinned this growth in electromobility. As global battery
production increases, unit costs are declining. Further efforts to reduce the GHG footprint of battery
production, however, are essential for maximising the mitigation potential of
BEVs. The continued
growth of electromobility for land transport would
entail
investments in electric charging and related
grid infrastructure. Electromobility powered by low
-
carbon electricity has the potential to rapidly
reduce transport GHG and can be
applied with multiple co
-
benefits
, especially
in the developing
countries

‘Active travel’ is travel that requires physical effort, for example journeys made by walking or
cycling.
