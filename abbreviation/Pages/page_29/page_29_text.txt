Projected global mean warming of the ensemble of modelled scenarios included in the climate categories C1-C8
and IMPs (based on emulators calibrated to the WGI assessment), as well as five illustrative scenarios (SSPx-y)
as considered by AR6 WG I. The left panel shows the p5-p95 range of projected median warming across global
modelled pathways within a category, with the category medians (line). The right panel shows the peak and 2100
emulated temperature outcomes for the categories C1 to C8 and for IMPs, and the five illustrative scenarios (SSPx-
y) as considered by AR6 WG I. The boxes show the p5-p95 range within each scenario category as in panel-a.
The combined p5-p95 range across scenarios and the climate uncertainty for each category C1- C8 is also shown
for 2100 warming (thin vertical lines). {Table SPM.1, Figure 3.11, WGI Figure SPM.8}
Methods to project global warming associated with the scenarios were updated to ensure consistency
with the AR6 WG1 assessment of physical climate science

FOOTNOTE 50:
This involved improved methodologies to use climate emulators (MAGICC7 and
FAIR v1.6), which were evaluated and calibrated to closely match the global warming response to
emissions as assessed in AR6 WGI. It included harmonisation of global GHG emissions in 2015 in
modelled scenarios (51-56 GtCO
2
-eq; 5th to 95th percentiles) with the corresponding emission value
underlying the CMIP6 projected climate response assessed by WG I (54 GtCO
2
-eq), based on similar
data sources of historical emissions that are updated over time. The assessment of past GHG emissions
in Chapter 2 of the report is based on a more recent dataset providing emissions of 57 [Â±6.3] GtCO
2
-eq
in 2015 (B.1). Differences are well within the assessed uncertainty range, and arise mainly from
differences in estimated CO

variability and revisions over time. Projected rates of global emission reduction in mitigation scenarios
