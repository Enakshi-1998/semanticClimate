Accelerating mitigation to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system
will require the integration of broadened assessment frameworks and tools that combine multiple
perspectives, applied in a context of multi
-
level governance
(
hi
gh confidence
).
Analysing a
challenge on the scale of fully decarbonising our economies entails integration of multiple analytic
frameworks. Approaches to risk assessment and resilience, established across IPCC Working Groups,
are complemented by framework
s for probing the challenges in implementing mitigation.
Aggregate
f
rameworks
include cost
-
effectiveness analysis towards given objectives, and cost
-
benefit analysis,
both of which have been developing to take fuller account of advances in understanding ri
sks and
innovation, the dynamics of
sectors and
systems and of climate impacts, and welfare economic theory
including growing consensus on long
-
term discounting.
Ethical frameworks
consider the fairness of
processes and outcomes which can help ameliorate d
istributional impacts across income groups,
countries and generations.
Transition and transformation frameworks
explain and evaluate the
dynamics of transitions to low
-
carbon systems arising from interactions amongst levels.
Psychological,
behavioural
and political frameworks
outline the constraints (and opportunities) arising from human
psychology and the power of incumbent interests.
A comprehensive understanding of climate mitigation
must combine these multiple frameworks. Together with established r
isk frameworks, these
collectively
help to explain potential synergies and trade
-
offs in mitigation, imply
ing
a need for a wide portfolio of
policies attuned to different actors and levels of decision
-
making, and underpin ‘just transition’
strategies in di
verse contexts
.

The speed, direction
,
and depth of any transition will be determined by choices in the
environmental, technological, economic, socio
-
cultural and institutional realms
(
high confidence
)
.
Transitions in specific
systems can be gradual or
can be
rapid and disruptive. The pace of a transition
can be impeded by ‘lock
-
in’ generated by existing physical capital, institutions, and social norms. The
interaction between politics
,
econom
ics and power relationships
is central
to
explaining why broad
commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to
,
and support for
,
climate policies and low carbon societal transition
s
has generally increased, as the impac
ts have become
more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and
balance of high and low carbon investments. Societal
and
behavioural norms, regulations and
institutions are essential conditions to accel
erate low carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst
addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major tr
ansition
.

Achieving the global transition to a low

carbon, climate
-
resilient and sustainable world requires
purposeful and increasingly
coordinated planning and decisions at many scales of governance
including local, subnational, national and global levels
(
high confidence
).
Accelerating mitigation
globally would imply strengthening policies adopted to date, expanding the effort across opt
ions,
sectors, and countries, and broadening responses to include more diverse actors and societal processes
at multiple
–
including international
–
levels.
The e
ffective governance of climate change entails strong
action across multiple jurisdictions and
decision
-
making levels, including regular evaluation and
learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes for making and implementing
relevant decisions involve a range of non
-
nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil so
ciety
organisations. At global, national and subnational levels, climate change actions are interwoven with
