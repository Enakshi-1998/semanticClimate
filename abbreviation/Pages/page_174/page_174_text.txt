Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG
III
Sub
-
national actors are important for mitigation because
municipalities and regional
governments have jurisdiction over climate
-
relevant sectors such as land
-
use, waste and urban
policy
. They
are able to experiment with climate solutions and can forge partnerships with the
private sector and internationally to l
everage enhanced climate action
(
high confidence
).
More
than 10,500 cities and nearly 250 regions representing more than 2 billion people have pledged largely
voluntary action to reduce emissions. Indirect gains include innovation, establishing norms and
developing capacity. However, sub
-
national actors often lack national support, funding, and capacity to
mobilize finance and human resources, and create new institutional competences.

Climate
litigation
is
growing
and
can
affect
the
outcome
and
ambition
of
climate
governance
(medium
evidence,
high
agreement)
.
Since
2015,
at
least
37
systemic
cases
have
been
initiated
against
states
that
challenge
the
overall
effort
of
a
state
to
mitigat
e
or
adapt
to
climate
change.
If
successful,
such
cases
can
lead
to
an
increase
in
a
country’s
overall
ambition
to
tackle
climate
change.
Climate
litigation
has
also
successfully
challenged
governments’
authori
s
ations
of
high
-
emitting
projects
setting
prec
edents
in
favour
of
climate
action.
Climate
litigation
against
private
sector
and
financial
institutions
is
also
on
the
rise.

The media shapes the public discourse about climate mitigation. This can usefully build public
support to accelerate mitiga
tion action but may also be used to impede decarbonisation
(medium
evidence, high agreement
)
.
Global media coverage (across a study of 59 countries) has been growing,
from about 47,000
articles
in 2016
-
17 to about 87,000 in 2020
-
21.
Generally
,
the media representation
of climate science has increased and become more accurate over time. On occasion, the propagation of
scientifically misleading information by organized counter
-
movements has fuelled polari
s
ation, with
negative implications for cli
mate policy.
{
13.4
}
Explicit attention to equity and justice is salient to both social acceptance and fair and effective
policymaking for mitigation
(
high confidence
).
Distributional implications of alternative climate
policy choices can be usefully evalua
ted at city, local and national scales as an input to policymaking.
It is anticipated that i
nstitutions and governance frameworks that enable consideration of justice and
just transitions
can
build broader support for climate policymaking
.

Carbon pricing is effective in promoting implementation of low
-
cost emissions reductions
(
high
confidence
).
While the coverage of emissions trading and carbon taxes has risen to over 20 percent of
global CO
2
emissions, both coverage and price are
lower than is needed for deep reductions.
M
arket
mechanisms
ideally are designed
to
be effective as well as efficient, balance distributional goals and
find social acceptance. Practical experience has driven progress in market mechanism design, especially
of emissions trading schemes. Carbon pricing is limited in its effect on adoption of
higher
-
cost
mitigation options, and where decisions are often not sensitive to price incentives such as in energy
efficiency, urban planning, and infrastructure
(robust evidence, medium agreement)
.
Subsidies have
been used to improve energy efficiency, en
courage the uptake of renewable energy and other sector
-
specific emissions saving options
{
13.6
}
Carbon pricing is most effective if revenues are redistributed or used impartially (
high
confidence
).
A carbon levy earmarked for green
infrastructures or saliently returned to taxpayers
corresponding to widely accepted notions of fairness increases the political acceptability of carbon
pricing. {
5.6, Box 5.11
}
Removing fossil fuel subsidies could reduce emissions by 1
-
10% by 2030 while
improving public
revenue and macroeconomic performance
(robust evidence, medium agreement).
{
13.6
}
Regulatory instruments play an important role in achieving specific mitigation outcomes in
sectoral applications
(
high confidence
).
Regulation is effective in particular applications and often
enjoys greater political support, but tends to be more economic
ally costly, than pricing instruments
