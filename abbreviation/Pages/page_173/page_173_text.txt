Panel a
: Shares of global GHG emissions under national climate change legislations
–
in
2010, 2015 and 2020. Climate legislation is defined as an act passed by a parlia
ment that includes
the
reduction
of
GHGs
in its title or objectives.
Panel b
: Shares of global GHG emissions under national climate emission targets
–
in 2010, 2015 and 2020.
Emissions reductions targets were taken into account as a legislative target wh
en they were defined in a law or
as part of a country's submission under the Kyoto Protocol, or as an executive target when they were included in
a national policy or official submissions under the UNFCCC. Targets were included if they were economy wide
or
included at least the energy sector. The proportion of national emissions covered are scaled to reflect
coverage and whether targets are in GHG or CO
2
terms.
Emissions data used are for 2019
. 2020 data was excluded as
emissions shares across regions devia
ted from past
patterns due to COVID

Climate governance is constrained and enabled by domestic structural factors, but it is still
possible for actors to make substantial changes
(
medium evidence, high agreement
)
.
Key structural
factors are domestic material endowments (such as fossil
fuels and land
-
based resources); domestic
political systems; and prevalent ideas, values and belief systems. Developing countries face additional
material constraints in climate governance due to development challenges and scarce economic or
natural resou
rces. A broad group of actors influence how climate governance develop over time,
including a range of civic organi
s
ations, encompassing both pro
-
and anti
-
climate action groups
