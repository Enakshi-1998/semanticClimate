coalitions to form

that

(Roberts et al. 201

, for example by
generat

concentrated benefits to coalition members
(Millar et al. 2020; Bernstein and Hoffmann 2018; Meckling
2019)
, as with renewable feed

tariffs (FiTs) in Germany
(Michaelowa et al. 2018)
.
Coalitions may
also be sustained by overarching framings, especia
lly to involve actors (e.g. NGOs) for whom the
benefits of climate policy are not narrowly economic.
However p
olicy design
can
also provoke
coalitions to oppose climate policy, as in the
F
i
T
programme in Ontario
(Stokes 2013; Raymond 2020)
or the
yellow vest
protests against carbon taxation in France
(Berry and Laurent 2019)
.
The ‘
just
transitions
’
frame can
thus also
be understood in terms of coalit
ion
-
building
, as well as ethics, as
the
pursuit
of low carbon transitions
which
spread the economic benefits broadly, through ‘green jobs’, and
the redistributive policies embedded in them both nationally and globally
(Healy and Barry 2017;
Winkler 2020)
.
Appropriate policy design will be different at different st
ages of the transition process
(Meckling et al. 2017; Breetz et al. 2018)
.
Integration.
Politics is ultimately the way in which societies make decisions
–
which in turn, reflect
diverse forces and assumed frameworks.
Effective policy
requires
understandings which combine
economic efficiency, ethics and equity, the dynamics and processes of l
arge
-
scale transitions, and the
role of psychology and politics.
No one framework is adequate to such a broad
-
ranging goal
, nor are
single tools
.
Chapter 13 (Figure 13.6) presents a ‘framing’ table for policy instruments depending on
the extent to which t
hey focus on mitigation
per se
or wider socio
-
economic development, and whether
they aim to shift marginal incentives or drive larger transitions.
Holistic analysis needs to bridge
modelling,
qualitative
transition
theories
illuminated by case studies,
and
practice
-
based action research
(Geels et al. 2016)
.
These analytic frameworks also point to arenas of potential synergies and trade
-
offs (when broadly
known), and opportunities and risks (when uncertaint
ies are greater), associated with mitigation.
Th
is
offers theoretical foundations
for mitigation strategies which
can also generate co
-
benefits. Climate
policy may help to motivate policies with beneficial synergies (such as the consumer cost savings from
energy efficiency, better forest management, transitions to cleaner vehicles) and opportunities (such as
stimulating innovation), by focusing on options for which the positives outweigh the negatives, or can
be made to through smart policy
(e.g. Karls
son et al. 2020)
.
More broadly, climate concerns may help
to attract international investment, and help overcoming bureaucratic or political obstacles to better
policy, to support synergies between mitigation, adaptation, and other SDGs, a foundation fo
r shifting
development pathways towards sustainability (
