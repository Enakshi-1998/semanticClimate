Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
Figure TS.7 legend:
The
upper panel shows levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) for rapidly changing
mitigation technologies
. Solid blue lines indicate average market cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas
show the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. Grey shading indicates the range of fossil fuel
(coal and gas) LCOE in 2020 (corresponding to
USD
55
-
148
per MWh). LCOE allows consistent comparisons
of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made; it does not include environmental
externalities and does not reflect variation in the value of electricity over time and space (see Chapter
6).
The lower panel shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for
renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to
indicate change since AR5. The market
share percentages shown are the 2020 shares based on provisional data,
i.e., percentage of total electricity production (for PV, Onshore wind, Offshore wind,
concentrating solar power
(
CSP
)
) and of passenger total vehicles (for electric vehicles). The elec
tricity market share is generally lower
than the share of production capacity given lower capacity factors for these renewable technologies.

Robust incentives for investment in innovation, especially incentives reinforced by national policy
and
international agreements, are central to accelerating low
-
carbon technological
change
(robust
evidence, medium agreement)
.
Policies have driven innovation, including instruments for technology
push (e.g., scientific training,
research and developmen
t (
R&D
)
) and demand pull (e.g., carbon pricing,
adoption subsidies), as well as those promoting knowledge flows and especially te
chnology transfer.
The magnitude of the scale
-
up challenge elevates the importance of rapid technology development and
adoption. This includes ensuring participation of developing countries in an enhanced global flow of
knowledge, skills, experience, equip
ment, and technology itself requires strong financial, institutional,
and capacity building support. {2.5.4, 2.5, 2.8}
Estimates of future CO
2
emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures already exceed
remaining cumulative net CO
2
emissions in path
ways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or
limited
overshoot
(
high confidence
).
Assuming variations in historic patterns of use and
decommissioning, estimated future CO
2
emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone are 660
(460
-
890) GtCO
2
and fr
om existing and currently planned infrastructure 850 (600
-
1100) GtCO
2
. This
compares to overall cumulative net CO
2
emissions until reaching net zero CO
2
of 510 (330
-
710) Gt
CO
2
in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and 8
9
0
(640
-
1160) Gt
CO
2
in
pathways that
likely
limit warming to 2°C (
high confidence
).
While most future CO
2
emissions from
existing and currently planned fossil fuel infrastructure are situated in the power sector, most remaining
fossil fuel CO
2
emissions in pa
thways that
likely
limit warming to 2°C and
below are from non
-
electric
energy
–
most importantly from the industry and transportation sectors (
high confidence
).
Decommissioning and reduced utili
s
ation of existing fossil fuel installations in the power sec
tor as well
as cancellation of new installations are required to align future CO
2
emissions from the power sector
with projections in these pathways (
high confidence
)
