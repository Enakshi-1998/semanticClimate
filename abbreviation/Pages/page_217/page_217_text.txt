SDGs.
In September 2015, the UN endorsed a universal agenda
–
‘Transform
ing our World: the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development’. The agenda adopted 17 non
-
legally
-
binding SDGs and 169
targets to support people,
peace,
prosperity, partnerships and the planet
.
While climate change is
explicitly listed as SDG13, the pursuit of the implementation of the UNFCCC is relevant for a number
of other goals including SDG 7 (clean energy for all), 9 (sustainable industry), and 11 (sustainable
cities),
12 (responsible cons
umption and production)
as well as those relating to life
below water (14)
and on land (15)
(Biermann et al. 2017)
. Mitigation a
ctions could have multiple synergies and trade
-
offs across the SDGs
(Chapter 17; Pradhan et al. 2017)
and their net effects depend on the pace and
magnitude of changes, the
specific
mitigation
choices
and the management of the transition. This
suggests that mit
igation must be pursued in the broader context of sustainable development
as explained
in
Section
1.6
Finance.
The Paris Agreement’s finance goal (above) reflects a broadened focus, beyond the costs of
climate adaptation and mitigation, to recognising that a structural shift towards low carbon climate
-
resilient development pathways requires large scale investments
that engage the wider financial system
(15.1 and 15.2.4). The SR1.5C report estimated that 1.5
o
C pathways would require
increased investment
of 0.5
-
1% of global GDP between now and 2050, which is up to 2.5% of global savings / investment
over the period. F
or low
-
and middle
-
income countries, SDG
-
compatible infrastructure investments in
the most relevant sectors are estimated to be around 4
-
5% of their GDP, and ‘infrastructure investment
paths compatible with full decarbonisation in the second half of the ce
ntury need not cost more than
more
-
polluting alternatives’
(Rozenberg and Fay 2019)
.
The parallel 2015 UN Addis Ababa Conference on Finance
for Development, and its resulting Action
Agenda, aims to ‘address the challenge of financing … to end poverty and hunger, and to achieve
sustainable development in its three dimensions through promoting inclusive economic growth,
protecting the environme
nt, and promoting social inclusion.’ The Conference recognises the significant
potential of regional co
-
operation and provides a forum for discussing the solutions to common
challenges faced by developing countries (15.6.4).
Alongside this, private and b
lended climate finance is increasing but is still short of projected
requirements consistent with Paris Agreement
goals
(15.3.2.1). The financing gap is particularly acute
for adaptation projects, especially in vulnerable developing countries. From a macro
-
regulatory
perspective, there is growing recognition that substantial financial value may be at risk from changing
regulation and technology in a low
-
carbon transition, with potential implications for global financial
stability (15.6.3). To date, the most
significant governance development is the Financial Stability
Board’s Task Force on Climate
-
related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and its recommendations that
investors and companies consider climate change risks in their strategies and capital allocation,
so
investors can make informed decisions
(TCFD 2018)
,
welcomed by over 500 financial institutions and
companies as signatories, albeit with patchy implementation (1.4.

; 15.6.3).
Talanoa Dialogue and Just Transition
.
As
mandated at Paris COP21 and l
aunched at COP23, the
‘Talanoa
Dialogue’
(UNFCCC 2018a)
emphasised holistic approaches across multiple
economic
sectors for climate change mitigation. At COP24 also, the Just Transition Silesia Declaration, focusing
on the need to consider social aspects in designing policies f
or climate change mitigation was signed
by 56 heads of state
(UNFCCC 2018b)
. This underlined the importance of aiming for a ‘
j
ust
t
ransition’
in terms of reducing emissions, at the same time preserving livelihoods a
nd managing economic risks
for countries and communities that rely heavily on emissions
