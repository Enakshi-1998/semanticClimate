. This strand of literature emphasises
the importance of economic growth including
for
tackling
climate change itself, pointing to the relationship between economic development and climate resilience
as well as
the role of industry
-
powered technologies such as electric vehicles
in reducing GHG levels
and promoting wellbeing
(Heinrichs et al. 2014; Kasztelan 2017)
.
Yet, others argue that the character
of social and economic development produced by the nature of capitalist society
(Pelling and Manuel
-
Navarrete 2011; Koch 2012; Malm 2016)
is ultimately unsustainable.
There are at least t
wo major implications of the very close link between climate change and
development as outlined above. The first is that the choice of development paths made by countries and
regions have significant consequences for GHG emissions and efforts to combat cli
mate change (see
Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 14). The second is that climate mitigation at local, national and global level
cannot be effectively achieved by a narrow focus on ‘climate
-
specific’ sectors, actors and policies; but
rather through a much broade
r attention to the mix of development choices and the resulting
development paths and trajectories
(see Cha
pter 4, 6, 10; O’Neill et al. 2014)
.
As a key staple of IPCC reports and global climate policy landscape
(Gidden et al. 2019; Quilcaille et
al. 2019; van Vuuren et al. 2017; IPCC 2014b, 2007; see also Chapter 2)
, integrated assessment models
and g
lobal scenarios (such as the “Shared Socio
-
Economic Pathways”
–
SSPs) highlight the interaction
between development paths, climate change and emission stabilisation (see
Section 3.6 in
Chapter 3
).
The close link
s are
also recognised in the PA
(section 1.3.
1).
The impact of climate change in limiting wellbeing is most acutely felt by the world’s poorest people,
communities, and nations, who have the smallest carbon footprint, constrained capacity to respond and
limited voice in important decision
-
making cir
cles
(Okereke and Ehresman 2015; Tosam and Mbih
2015; Mugambiwa and Tirivangasi 2017)
. The wide variation in the contribution to, and impact of
climate change within and across co
untries makes equity, inequality, justice, and poverty eradication,
inescapable aspects of the relationship between sustainable development and climate change
(Reckie
n
et al. 2017; Okereke and Coventry 2016; Bos and Gupta 2019; Klinsky et al. 2017; Baarsch et al. 2020;
Kayal et al. 2019; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019)
. This underpins the conclusion as commonly expressed
that climate action needs to be pursued in the context of sustainable development, equity and poverty
eradication
(Burton et al. 2001; Smit et al. 2001; Klinsky and Winkler 2014; Tschakert and Olsson
2005; IPCC 2014a, 2018b)
.
1.6.2
Concepts and frameworks for integrating climate mitigation and development:
At one level, sustainable
development can be seen as a meta framework for integrating climate action
with other global sustainability goals
(Antal and Van Den Bergh 2016; Casadio Tarabusi and Guarini
2013)
.
Fundamentally, the concept of sustainable development underscores the interlinkages and
interdependence of human and natural systems
and the
need to balance economic, social, and
environmental (including climate pollution) aspects in development planning and processes
(Nunan
2017; Gomez
-
Echeverri 2018b; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019)
.
D
espite the appeal of the concept, tensions remain over the interpretation and practical application, with
acute disagreements regarding what the balancing entails in real life, how to measure wel
lbeing, which
goals to set, and the means through which such goals might be pursued
(Michelsen et al. 2016; Shang
et al. 2019; Okereke and Massaquoi 2017; UNEP 2018b; Arrow et al. 2011; Dasgupta et al. 2015;
Sugiawan et al. 2019; Haberl et al. 2019)
.
Moreover, countries differ enormously in their respective situation regarding their d
evelopment path
–
a condition which affects their capability, goals, priorities and approach to the pursuit of sustainability
(Ramos
-
Mejía et al. 2018; Okereke et al. 2019; Shi et al. 2016)
.
Most of the literature recognises that
despite its limitations, s
ustainable development with its emphasis on integrating social, economic and
environmental goals, provides a more comprehensive approach to the pursuit of planetary health and
