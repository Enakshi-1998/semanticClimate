By 2050, comprehensive demand-side strategies across all sectors could reduce CO
2
and non-
CO
2
GHG emissions globally by 40â€“70% compared to the 2050 emissions projection of two scenarios
consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. With policy support, socio-
cultural options, and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors by at
least 5% rapidly, with most of the potential in developed countries, and more until 2050, if combined
with improved infrastructure design and access. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute
disproportionately to emissions and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens,
investors, consumers, role models, and professionals. (

A range of 5-30% of global annual GHG emissions from end-use sectors are avoidable by
2050, compared to 2050 emissions projection of two scenarios consistent with policies announced by
national governments until 2020, through changes in the built environment, new and repurposed
infrastructures and service provision through compact cities, co-location of jobs and housing, more
efficient use of floor space and energy in buildings, and reallocation of street space for active mobility
(

Choice architecture [FOOTNOTE 63] can help end-users adopt, as relevant to consumers,
culture and country contexts, low GHG intensive options such as balanced, sustainable healthy
diets[FOOTNOTE 62] acknowledging nutritional needs; food waste reduction; adaptive heating and
cooling choices for thermal comfort; integrated building renewable energy; and electric light-duty
vehicles, and shifts to walking, cycling, shared pooled and public transit; sustainable consumption by
intensive use of longer-lived repairable products (

forms of status consumption [FOOTNOTE 64]
and focusing on wellbeing supports climate change

FOOTNOTE 63
: Choice architecture describes the presentation of choices to consumers, and the
impact that presentation has on consumer decision-making.
FOOTNOTE 64
: Status consumption refers to the consumption of goods and services which publicly
demonstrates social prestige.
