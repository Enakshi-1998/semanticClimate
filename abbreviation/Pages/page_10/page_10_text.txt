open-ended category) spend more than USD23PPP per capita per day. The wide range of estimates for
the contribution of the top 10% result from the wide range of spending in this category and differing
methods in the assessed literature. {Annex I: Glossary; 2.6}
B.3.5
At least 18 countries have sustained production-based GHG and consumption-based CO
2
emission reductions for longer than 10 years. Reductions were linked to energy supply decarbonisation,
energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes
in economic structure. Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or
more since peaking, and some have achieved several years of consecutive reduction rates of around 4
%/yr, comparable to global reductions in scenarios limiting warming to 2Â°C (>67%) or lower. These
reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth. (
