benefits and help address many of the wider challenges associated with land
management. If AFOLU measures are deployed badly then, when taken together with the increasi

need to produce sufficient food, feed, fuel and wood, they may exacerbate trade

emission fluxes. The rate of deforestation, which
accounts for 45% of total AFOLU emissions, has generally declined, while global tree cover and
global forest growing stock levels are
likely
increasing (

There are substantial
regional differences, with losses of carbon generally observed in tropical regions and gains in temperate
and boreal regions. Agricultural CH

anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks
reported by
governments under the UNFCCC
are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed land’. Managed land is land
where human interventions
and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions.

For example: in the
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories
,
CO
2
emissions from biomass used for energy are reported in the AFOLU sector, calculated as an
implicit component of carbon stock changes. In the energy sector,
CO
2
emissions from biomass combustion for
energy
are recorded as an information item that is not in
cluded in the sectoral total emissions for the that sector.
