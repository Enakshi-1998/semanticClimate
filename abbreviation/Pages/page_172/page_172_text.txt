TS. 6.1
Policy and Institutions
Long
-
term deep emission reductions, including the reduction of emissions to net zero, is best
achieved through institutions and governance that nurture new mitigatio
n policies, while at the
same time reconsidering existing policies that support
the continued emission of
GHG
s
(
high
confidence
).
To do so effectively, the scope of climate governance
needs to
include both direct efforts
to target GHG emissions and
indirect opportunities to tackle GHG emissions that result from efforts
directed towards other policy objectives
.

Institutions and governance underpin mitigation by providing the legal basis for action. This
includes setting
up implementing organisations and the frameworks through which diverse actors
interact
(medium evidence, high agreement)
.
Institutions can create mitigation and sectoral policy
instruments; policy packages for low
-
carbon system transition; and
economy wide measures for
systemic restructuring.

Policies have had a discernible impact on mitigation for specific countries, sectors, and

.
Both market
-
based and regulatory policies have distinct, but complementary roles. The share of global
GHG emissions subject to mitigation policy has increased rapidly in recent years, but big gaps remain
in policy coverage, and the stringency of many polic
ies falls short of what is needed to achieve
the
desired
mitigation
outcomes

Climate laws enable mitigation action by signalling the direction of travel, setting targets,
mainstreaming
mitigation into sector policies, enhancing regulatory certainty, creating law
-
backed agencies, creating focal points for social mobili
s
ation, and attracting international finance
(medium evidence, high agreement)
.
By 2020, ‘direct’ climate laws primarily f
ocused on GHG
reductions were present in 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions
(see

igure TS.24)

ore
than 690 laws, including ‘indirect’ laws,
however,
may also have an effect on mitigation. Among direct
laws, ‘framework’ laws set an overarching
legal basis for mitigation either by pursuing a target and
implementation approach, or by seeking to mainstream climate objectives through sectoral plans and
integrative institutions.

Institutions can enable improved governance by coordinating across sectors, scales and actors,
building consensus for action, and setting
strategies
(medium evidence, high agreement)
.
Institutions are more stable and effective when they are
congru
ent
with
national context
s
, leading to
mitigation
-
focused institutions in some countries and the pursuit of multiple objectives in others. Sub
-
national institutions play a complementary role to national institutions by developing locally
-
relevant
visions and plans,
addressing policy gaps or limits in national institutions, building local administrative
structures and convening actors for place
-
based decarbonisation.
{

}
Mitigation strategies, instruments and policies that fit with dominant ideas, values and belie
f
systems within a country or within a sector are more easily adopted and implemented
(medium
confidence)
.
Ideas, values and beliefs may change over time.
Policies that bring perceived direct
benefits, such as subsidies, usually receive greater
support. The awareness of co
-
benefits for the public
increases support of climate policie
s
(
high confidence
).
