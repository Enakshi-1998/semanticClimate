including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity. In many countries,
especially those with limited institutional capacities, several adverse side-effects have been observed as
a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on
foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling
conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater
public support for policy.

Digital technologies can contribute to mitigation of climate change and the achievement of
several SDGs (
high confidence
). For example, sensors, Internet of Things, robotics, and artificial
intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors, increase energy efficiency, and promote the
adoption of many low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, while creating
economic opportunities (
high confidence
). However, some of these climate change mitigation gains can
be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in demand for goods and services due to the use of digital
devices (
high confidence
). Digitalisation can involve trade-offs across several SDGs, e.g., increasing
electronic waste, negative impacts on labour markets, and exacerbating the existing digital divide.
Digital technology supports decarbonisation only if appropriately governed (
high confidence
