C.1.2
In modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming immediate action, global
net CO
2
emissions are reduced compared to modelled 2019 emissions by 27% [11–46%] in 2030 and
by 52% [36-70%] in 2040; and global CH
4
emissions are reduced by 24% [9–53%] in 2030 and by
37% [20–60%] in 2040. In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot
global net CO
2
emissions are reduced compared to modelled 2019 emissions by 48% [36–69%] in
2030 and by 80% [61-109%] in 2040; and global CH
4
emissions are reduced by 34% [21–57%] in
2030 and 44% [31-63%] in 2040. There are similar reductions of non-CO
2
emissions by 2050 in both
types of pathways: CH
4
is reduced by 45% [25–70%]; N
2
O is reduced by 20% [-5 – 55%]; and F-
Gases are reduced by 85% [20–90%]. [FOOTNOTE 44] Across most modelled pathways, this is the
maximum technical potential for anthropogenic CH
4
reductions in the underlying models
(high
confidence)
. Further emissions reductions, as illustrated by the IMP-SP pathway, may be achieved
through changes in activity levels and/or technological innovations beyond those represented in the
majority of the pathways
(medium confidence)
. Higher emissions reductions of CH
4
could further
reduce peak warming. (

C.1.3
In modelled pathways consistent with the continuation of policies implemented by the end of
2020, GHG emissions continue to rise, leading to global warming of 3.2 [2.2–3.5]°C by 2100 (within
C5-C7, Table SPM 1) (
medium confidence
). Pathways that exceed warming of >4°C (≥50%) (C8,
SSP5-8.5, Table SPM.1) would imply a reversal of current technology and/or mitigation policy trends
(
medium confidence
). Such warming could occur in emission pathways consistent with policies
implemented by the end of 2020 if climate sensitivity is higher than central estimates (
high
confidence
). (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.4) {3.3, Box 3.3}
C.1.4
Global modelled pathways falling into the lowest temperature category of the assessed literature
(C1, Table SPM.1) are on average associated with a higher median peak warming in AR6 compared
to pathways in the same category in SR1.5. In the modelled pathways in AR6, the likelihood of
limiting warming to 1.5°C has on average declined compared to SR1.5. This is because GHG
emissions have risen since 2017, and many recent pathways have higher projected emissions by 2030,
higher cumulative net CO
2
emissions and slightly later dates for reaching net zero CO
2
or net zero
GHG emissions. High mitigation challenges, for example, due to assumptions of slow technological
change, high levels of global population growth, and high fragmentation as in the Shared
Socioeconomic Pathway SSP3, may render modelled pathways that
limit warming to 2
°
C (> 67%) or
lower infeasible. (

different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) and 2100 warming levels.
