Cost reductions in key
technologies, particularly in electricity and light

duty transport, have increased the economic
attractiveness of near

term low

carbon transitions.
Long

term mitigation costs are not well un
derstood
and depend on policy design and implementation, and the future costs and availability of technologies.
Advances in low

carbon energy resources and carriers such as next

generation biofuels, hydrogen
produced from electrolysis, synthetic fuels, and

neutral ammonia would substantially improve
the economics of net
zero energy systems (
