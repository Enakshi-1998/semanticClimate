Figure SPM.6 covers the indicative potential of demand-side options for the year 2050. Figure SPM.7 covers cost
and potentials for the year 2030. Demand-side mitigation response options are categorised into three broad
domains: ‘socio-cultural factors’, associated with individual choices, behaviour; and lifestyle changes, social
norms and culture; ‘infrastructure use’, related to the design and use of supporting hard and soft infrastructure that
enables changes in individual choices and behaviour; and ‘end-use technology adoption’, refers to the uptake of
technologies by end-users. Demand side mitigation is a central element of the IMP-LD and IMP-SP scenarios
(Figure SPM.5).
Panel (a) (Nutrition) demand-side potentials in 2050 assessment is based on bottom-up studies and estimated
following the 2050 baseline for the food sector presented in peer-reviewed literature (more information in
Supplementary Material 5.II, and 7.4.5). Panel (b) (Manufactured products, mobility, shelter) assessment of
potentials for total emissions in 2050 are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom up studies representing
all global regions (detailed list is in Table SM5.2). Baseline is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in
2050 of the two scenarios consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. The heights of
the coloured columns represent the potentials represented by the median value. These are based on a range of
values available in the case studies from literature shown in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II. The range is
