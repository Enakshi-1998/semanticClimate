the nature of this relationship can vary by level of income and development (

Evidence of rapid energy transitions exists
in some case studies
(medium confidence)
.
Emerging
evidence since AR5 on pa
st energy transitions identifies a growing number of cases of accelerated
technology diffusion at sub
-
global scales and describes mechanisms by which future energy transitions
may occur more quickly than those in the past. Important drivers include technol
ogy transfer and
cooperation,
international
policy and financial support, and harnessing synergies among technologies
within a sustainable energy system perspective
(medium
confidence
)
.
A fast global low

carbon energy
transition enabled by finance to facilitate low
-
carbon technology adoption in deve
loping and
particularly in least developed countries can facilitate achieving climate stabilisation
targets

Multiple low

carbon technologies have shown rapid progress since AR5
–
in cost, performance,
and adoption
–
en
hancing the feasibility of rapid energy transitions
(
high confidence
).
The
rapid
deployment
and unit cost decrease of modular technologies like solar, wind, and batteries have occurred
much faster than anticipated by experts and modelled in previous mitiga
tion scenarios
, as shown in

(
high confidence
).
The
political, economic, social, and technical feasibility of solar energy,
wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years. In
contrast, the adoption of nuclear energy and CO
2
capture and storage
(CCS)
in th
e electricity sector has
been slower than the growth rates anticipated in stabilisation scenarios. Emerging evidence since AR5
indicates that small
-
scale technologies (e.g.
,
solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more
quickly than large
-
sc
ale
technologies (nuclear, CCS)
(medium
confidence
)
