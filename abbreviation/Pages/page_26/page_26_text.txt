Cumulative emissions are calculated from the start of 2020 to the time of net zero and 2100, respectively.
They are based on harmonized net CO
2
emissions, ensuring consistency with the WG I assessment of the
remaining carbon budget. {Box 3.4, FOOTNOTE 51 in SPM C.2}.

Global mean
temperature change for category (at peak, if peak temperature occurs before 2100, and in 2100)
relative to 1850â€“1900, based on the median global warming for each pathway assessed using the probabilistic
climate model emulators calibrated to the AR6 WG I assessment, see also SPM Scenarios Box. {SPM
FOOTNOTE 12, WG I Cross Chapter Box 7.1, Annex III.II.2.5}.
15
Probability of staying below the temperature thresholds for the pathways in each category, taking into
consideration the range of uncertainty from the climate model emulators consistent with the AR6 WG I
assessment. The probabilities refer to the probability at peak temperature. Note that in the case of temperature
overshoot (e.g., category C2 and some pathways in C1), the probabilities of staying below at the end of the
century are higher than the probabilities at peak temperature.
