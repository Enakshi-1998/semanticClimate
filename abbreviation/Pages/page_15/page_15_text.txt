In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and
accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed
emissions (

). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to
avoided global emissions of several Gt CO

At least 1.8 Gt CO

can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory
instruments. Growing numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and were

B.5.4
Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up to
60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20 (in USD2015), but average growth has slowed since 2018
23
(
medium confidence
).
These financial flows remained heavily focused on mitigation, are uneven, and
have developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors (
high confidence
)
.
In 2018, public and
publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from developed to developing countries were below
the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilize USD 100 billion per year by
2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation (
medium
confidence
).
Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate
adaptation and mitigation (
high confidence
). Markets for green bonds, ESG (environmental, social and
governance) and sustainable finance products have expanded significantly since AR5. Challenges
remain, in particular around integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of these
markets to many developing countries. (

FOOTNOTE 23:
Estimates of financial flows (comprising both private and public, domestic and
international flows) are based on a single report which assembles data from multiple sources and which
has applied various changes to their methodology over the past years. Such data can suggest broad
trends but is subject to uncertainties.
B.6 Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) announced prior to COP26 [FOOTNOTE 24] would make it
likely
that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century.[FOOTNOTE 25]
Likely
limiting
warming to below 2°C would then rely on a rapid acceleration of mitigation efforts after 2030.
Policies implemented by the end of 2020 [FOOTNOTE 26] are projected to result in higher global
GHG emissions than those implied by NDCs
.

FOOTNOTE 24:
NDCs announced prior to COP26 refer to the most recent nationally determined
contributions submitted to the UNFCCC up to the literature cut-off date of this report, 11 October 2021,
and revised NDCs announced by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea prior to October 2021 but
only submitted thereafter. 25 NDC updates were submitted between 12 October 2021 and prior to the
start of COP26.
FOOTNOTE 25:
This implies that mitigation after 2030 can no longer establish a pathway with less
than 67% probability to exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, a defining feature of the class of pathways
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot assessed in this report (Category C1
in Table SPM.1). These pathways limit warming to 1.6°C or lower throughout the 21st century with a
50% likelihood.
