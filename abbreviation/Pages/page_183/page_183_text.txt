are aligned with different analytic framewor
ks, including assumptions about the main barriers to
mitigation that international cooperation can help overcome. The extent to which countries increase the
ambition of their NDCs and ensure they are effectively implemented will depend in part on the
succe
ssful implementation of the support mechanisms in the Paris Agreement, and in turn will
determine whether the goals of the Paris Agreement are met (
high confidence
). {14.2, 14.3, 14.4}
International cooperation outside the UNFCCC processes and agreements
provides critical
support for mitigation in particular regions, sectors and industries, for particular types of
emissions, and at the sub
-
and trans
-
national levels (
high confidence
).
Agreements addressing ozone
depletion, transboundary air pollution, and
release of mercury are all leading to reductions in the
emissions of specific greenhouse gases. Cooperation is occurring at multiple governance levels
including cities. Transnational partnerships and alliances involving non
-
state and sub
-
national actors
ar
e also playing a growing role in stimulating low
-
carbon technology diffusion and emissions
reductions (
medium confidence
). Such transnational efforts include those focused on climate litigation;
the impacts of these are unclear but promising. Climate chang
e is being addressed in a growing number
of international agreements operating at sectoral levels, as well as within the practices of many
multilateral organisations and institutions. Sub
-
global and regional cooperation, often described as
climate clubs, c
an play an important role in accelerating mitigation, including the potential for reducing
mitigation costs through linking national carbon markets, although actual examples of these remain
limited. {14.2, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6}
International cooperation will
need to be strengthened in several key respects in order to support
mitigation action consistent with limiting temperature rise to
well below
2°C in the context of
sustainable development and equity
(high confidence)
.
Many developing countries’ NDCs have
components or additional actions that are conditional on receiving assistance with respect to finance,
technology development and transfer, and capacity building, greater than what has been provided to
date. Sectoral an
d sub
-
global cooperation is providing critical support, and yet there is room for further
progress. In some cases, notably with respect to aviation and shipping, sectoral agreements have
adopted climate mitigation goals that fall far short of what would be
required to achieve the
long
-
term
temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Moreover, there are cases where international cooperation
may be hindering mitigation efforts, namely evidence that trade and investment agreements, as well as
agreements within th
e energy sector, impede national mitigation efforts (
medium confidence
).
International cooperation is emerging but so far fails to fully address transboundary issues associated
with solar radiation modification and carbon dioxide removal

Societal
aspects of mitigation
Social equity reinforces capacity and motivation for mitigating climate change (
medium
confidence
).
Impartial governance such as fair treatment by law
-
and
-
order institutions, fair treatment
by gender, and income equity, increases social trust, thus enabling demand
-
side climate policies.
High
status (often high carbon) item consumption may be reduced by t
axing absolute wealth without
compromising well
-
being. {

}
Policies that increase the political access and participation of women, raciali
s
ed, and marginalised
groups, increase the democratic impetus for climate action (
high confidence
)
.
Including more
differently situated knowledge and diverse perspectives makes climate mitigation policies more
effective.
