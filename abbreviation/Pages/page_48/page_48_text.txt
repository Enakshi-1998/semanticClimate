The removal and storage of CO

through vegetation and soil management can be reversed by
human or natural disturbances; it is also prone to climate change impacts. In comparison, CO
2
stored in
geological and ocean reservoirs (via BECCS, DACCS, ocean alkalinisation) and as carbon in biochar
is less prone to reversal.

In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions CDR can fulfil three different
complementary roles globally or at country level: lowering net CO
2
or net GHG emissions in the near-
term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions (e.g., emissions from agriculture, aviation,
shipping, industrial processes) in order to help reach net zero CO
2
or net zero GHG emissions in the
mid-term; achieving net negative CO
2
or GHG emissions in the long-term if deployed at levels
exceeding annual residual emissions (

Rapid emission reductions in all sectors interact with future scale of deployment of CDR
methods, and their associated risks, impacts and co-benefits. Upscaling the deployment of CDR
methods depends on developing effective approaches to address sustainability and feasibility
constraints, potential impacts, co-benefits and risks. Enablers of CDR include accelerated research,
development and demonstration, improved tools for risk assessment and management, targeted
incentives and development of agreed methods for measurement, reporting and verification of carbon
flows. (

C.12 Mitigation options costing USD100 tCO

or less could reduce global GHG emissions
by at least half the 2019 level by 2030 (
high confidence
). Global GDP continues to grow in
modelled pathways
[FOOTNOTE 65] but, without accounting for the economic benefits of
mitigation action from avoided damages from climate change nor from reduced adaptation costs,
it is a few percent lower in 2050 compared to pathways without mitigation beyond current
policies. The global economic benefit of limiting warming to 2°C is reported to exceed the cost of
mitigation in most of the assessed literature. (

Based on a detailed sectoral assessment of mitigation options, it is estimated that mitigation
options costing USD100 tCO
2
-eq
-1
or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half of the
2019 level by 2030 (options costing less than USD20 tCO
2
-eq
-1
are estimated to make up more than half
of this potential) [FOOTNOTE 66]. For a smaller part of the potential, deployment leads to net cost
savings. Large contributions with costs less than USD20 tCO
2
-eq
-1
come from solar and wind energy,
energy efficiency improvements, reduced conversion of natural ecosystems, and CH
4
emissions
reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste). The mitigation potentials and mitigation costs of individual
technologies in a specific context or region may differ greatly from the provided estimates. The
assessment of the underlying literature suggests that the relative contribution of the various options
could change beyond 2030. (
