and time discount rate. AR5 introduced a broader range of goals (material, social, and psychological)
and decision processes (calculation

based processes). However, its
perspective was still individual

an

focused, neglecting structural, cultural, and institutional
constraints and the influence of physical and social context.
A social science perspective is important in two ways. By adding new actors and perspectives, it (
i
)
provides more options fo
r climate mitigation; and (
ii
) helps to identify and address important social and
cultural barriers and opportunities to socioeconomic, technological, and institutional change. Demand
-
side mitigation involves five sets of social actors: individuals (e.g.,
consumption choices, habits),
groups and collectives (e.g., social movements, values), corporate actors (e.g., investments,
advertising), institutions (e.g., political agency, regulations), and infrastructure actors (e.g., very long
-
term investments and f
inancing). Actors either contribute to the status
-
quo of a global high

consumption, and GDP growth

services, well

set of actors

the design and implementation of

side mitigation policies. They show
important synergies, making
energy demand
mitigation a dynamic problem where the packaging and/or
sequencing of different policies play a
role in their effectiveness {5.5, 5.6}.
Incremental interventions
change social practices, simultaneously affecting emissions and well
-
being. The transformative change
requires coordinated action
across all
five
sets of actors
(Table 5.4), using social sci
ence insights about
intersection of behaviour, culture, institutional and infrastructural changes for policy design and
implementation.

They are instigated by role models, changing social norms driven by
policies and social movements. They also require appropriate infrastructures designed by urban
planners and building and transport professionals, corresponding investments, and a political
culture
supportive of demand side mitigation action.

reduce upstream energy demand by 45% in 2050.
