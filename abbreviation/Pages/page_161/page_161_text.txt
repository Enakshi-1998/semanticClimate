Demand
-
side aspects of mitigation
The a
ssessment of the social science literature and regional case studies reveals how social norms,
culture, and individual choices interact with infrastructure and other structural changes over time. This
provides new insight into climate change mitigation str
ategies, and how economic and social activity
might be
organised across sectors to support emission reductions. To enhance well
-
being, people
demand services and not primary energy and physical resources per se. Focusing on demand for services
and the diff
erent social and political roles people play broadens the participation in climate action.

(ASI) options,
that reflect opportunities for socio

: A New Chapter in WG
III AR6 Focusing on
the
Social Science of Demand
,
and
Social Aspects of Mitigation
The
WG III contribution to the
Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6) features a distinct chapter
on demand, services and social aspects of mitigation {5}. The scope, theories, and evidence for such an
assessment are addressed in Sections 5.1 and 5.4 within Chapter 5 and a Social Sci
ence Primer as an
Appendix to Chapter 5.
The literature on social science
–
from sociology, psychology, gender studies and political science for
example
–
and climate change mitigation is growing rapidly. A bibliometric search of the literature
identified
99,065 peer
-
reviewed academic papers, based on 34 search queries with content relevant to
Chapter 5. This literature is expanding by 15% per year, with twice as many publications in the AR6
period (2014
-
2020) as in all previous years.
The
models of stake
holders’ decisions
assessed by IPCC
have continuously evolved. From AR1 to
AR4, rational choice was the implicit assumption: agents with perfect information and unlimited
