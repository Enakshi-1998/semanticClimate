International cooperative initiatives between and among non

state (e.g., business, investors, civil society)
and subnational (e.g., city, state) actors h
ave also been emerging, taking the forms of public

private
partnerships, private sector governance initiatives, NGO transnational initiatives, and subnational
transnational initiatives
(Bulkeley and Schroeder 2012; Hsu et al. 2018)
. Literature is mostly positive about
the role of these transn
ational initiatives in facilitating climate action across scales although criticism and
caution about their accountability and effectiveness remain
(Chan et al. 2016; Roger et al. 2017; Widerberg
and Pattberg 2017; Michaelowa and

Emissions Scenarios and Illustrative Mitigation
Pathways
(IMPs)
Scenarios are a powerful tool for exploring an uncertain future world against the background of alternative
choices and development. Scenarios can be constructed using both narrative and quantitative methods.
When these two methods are
combined they provi
de complementary information and insights. Quantitative
and narrative models are frequently used to represent scenarios to explore choices and challenges. The
IPCC has a long history of assessing scenarios
(Nakicenovic et al. 2000; van Vuuren et al. 2011, 2014; see
also section 1.6 of AR6 WGI for a history of scenarios within the IPCC)
. This
WGIII
assessme
nt employs
a wide range of qualitative and quantitative scenarios including quantitative scenarios developed
through a
wide and heterogeneous set of tools ranging from spreadsheets to complex computational models
(Annex
III
provides further discussion an
d examples of computational models).
The concept of an
illustrative pathway (IP)
was introduced in IPCC Special Report on 1.5
(IPCC 2018b)
to highlight a
subset
of
the
quantitative scenarios, drawn from a larger pool
of published literature,
with
specific characteristics
that would help represent some of the key findings emerging from the assessment
in terms of
different strategies, ambitions and options available to achieve the Paris goals
.
Integrated Assessment Mode
ls
(IAMs) are the primary tools for quantitatively evaluating the technological
and macro
-
economic implications of decarbonisation, particularly for global long
-
term pathways. They
broadly divide into ‘stylized aggregate benefit
-
cost models’, and more comp
lex, ‘detailed process’ IAMs
(Weyant 2017)
, often mirroring the benefit
-
cost and cost
-
effective approaches outlined in 1.7.1
,
with more
detailed classification in
eg.
Nikas et al.
(2019)
.
IAMs embody a number of
structural and socio
-
demographic assumptions and include multiple modelling approaches, ranging from economic optimising
behaviour to simulation
(See Annex
III
).
Detailed process models
can
include energy system models used
to analyse
decarbonisation
and
‘net zero’ scenarios
by
international
agencies
(eg.
IEA 2020a)
.
Calculating cost
-
effective trajectories towards give
n goals typica
lly involves det
ailed process IAMs. Often
these calculate the dynamic portfolio of technologies consistent with a given climate target.
Some track
records of technology
forecasting in
IAMs
are outlined in Chapters 2
.5.4,
and
Box 16.

.
Climate
targets
may be imposed in models in a variety of ways that include, but
are
not limited to, constraints on emissions
or cumulated emissions (carbon budgets), and the pricing of emissions. The time
-
path of mitigation costs
calculated through these models m
ay be translated into ‘shadow prices’ that (like the social
-
cost
-
of
-
carbon)
offer a benchmark to assess the cost
-
effectiveness of investments, as used by some governments and
companies (1.8.2).
Scenarios in the IPCC and AR6.
For AR6, WG III
received submissions of more than 2
5
00 model
-
based
scenarios published in the scientific literature
. Such scenarios, which
explore different possible evolutions
of future energy and land use (with or without climate policy) and
associated emissions, are ma
de available
