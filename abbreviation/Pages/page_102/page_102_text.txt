AR6 WG III
TS. 4.2
Long
-
term mitigation pathways
The characteristics of a wide range of long
-
term mitigation pathways, their common elements
and differences are assessed in Chapter 3. Differences between pathways typically represent
choices that can steer the system in alternative directions through the
selection of different
combinations of response
options
(high confidence).
More than 2000 quantitative emissions
pathways were
submitted to the
AR
6 scenario
s
database,
of which
more than 1200
pathways
included
sufficient information for
the associated warm
ing
to be assessed
(
consistent with
AR6
WG
I
methods
)
.
(Box TS.5)
{3.2, 3.3}
Many pathways in the literature show how to
likely
limit global warming to 2°C with no overshoot
or to limit warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot compared to 1850
-
1900. The likelihood of
limiting warming to 1.5
°
C with no or limited overshoot has dropped in AR6 WG III compared
to AR6 SR1.5 because globa
l GHG emissions have risen since 201
7
, leading to higher near
-
term
emissions (2030) and higher cumulative CO
2
emissions until the time of net
zero
(medium
confidence).
Only a small number of published pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without
overshoo
t over the course of the 21
st
century. {3.3, Annex
III
.II.3}
Mitigation pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach 50% CO
2
reductions in the 2030s, relative to 2019, then reduce emissions further to reach net zero CO
2
emissions in the 2050s. Pathways
likely
limiting warming to 2°C reach 50% reductions in the
2040s and net zero CO
2
by
2070s (
medium confidence
)
.

pathways
explore
different possible evolutions of future energy and land use (with

without
climate policy) and the
consequences for greenhouse gas emissions.
From the full range of
pathways
, five archetype scenarios

Illustrative
Mitigation Pathways
(IMPs)
–
were selected to illustrate key
mitigation

A further

pathways illustrative of high emissions

continuation of current policies or moderately increase

were selected to

the consequences
of current policies and pledges. Together the
se pathways
provide illustrations of potential future
developments that can be shaped by human choices, including: Where are current policies and pledges
leading us? What is needed to reach
specific temperature goals? What are the consequences of
using
different strategies to meet these goals? What are the consequences of delay? How can we shift
development from current practices to
give
higher priority
to
sustainability and the SDGs?
