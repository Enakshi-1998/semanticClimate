foundations, and in most applications, a number of additional assumptions detailed in AR5 (Chapters 2
and 3).
1.7.1.1
Cost
-
benefit and cost
-
effectiveness analysis
Such global aggregate economic
studies
coalesce around two main
questions.
One,
as pioneered by
Nordhaus
(
1992;
2008)
attempt
s
to
monetize overall
climate damages
and
mitigation
costs so as to
strike a
‘
cost
-
benefit
optimum
’
pathway
.
More
detailed and empirically
-
grounded
‘cost
-
effectiveness
analysis
’
explores pathways
that would minimise mitigation costs
(IPCC 2014a section 2.5; Ekholm
2014; Weyant 2017)
for
given
targets
(e.g.
as agreed in
international
negotiations
, see
Section 3.2 in
C
hapter
3).
Both approaches recognise that resources are limited, and climate change competes with
other priorities in government policymaking, and are generally examined with some form of Integrated
Assessment Model (
IAMs
:
see
1.5, and
Appendix C). Depending on t
he regional disaggregation of the
modelling
tools used and on the scope of the analyses, these studies may or may not
address
distributional aspects
within and across nations associated with climate policies
(Bauer et al. 2020)
.
For at least 10
-
15 years after the first computed global cost
-
benefit estimate
(Nordhaus 1992)
, the
d
ominant conclusions from these different approaches seemed to yield very different recommendations,
with cost
-
benefit studies suggesting lenient mitigation compared to the climate targets typically
recommended from scientific risk assessments
(Weyant 2017)
. Over the past 10
-
15 years, literature has
made important strides towards reconciling these two approaches, both in the analytic methods and the
conclusions arising.
Damages and risks
Incorporating impacts
which may be extremely severe but are uncertain (known as
“fat tails”
(Weitzman 2009, 2011)
, strengthens the economic ca
se for ambitious action to avoid risks of
extreme climate impacts
(Ackerman et al. 2010; Dietz and Stern 2015; Fankhauser et al. 2013)
. The
salience of risks has also been amplified by improved understanding of climate ‘tipping points’
(Lontzek et al. 2015; Lenton et al. 2019)
; valuations should reflect that
cutting emissions reduces not
only
average
expected damages, but also the risk of catastrophic events
(IWG 2021)
.
Discounting.
The role of time
-
disco
unting, in weighting future climate change impacts against today’s
costs of mitigating emissions, has been long recognised
(Weitzman 1994, 20
01; Nordhaus 2007;
Dasgupta 2008; Stern 2007)
. Its importance is underlined in analytical Integrated Assessment Models
(IAMs)
(Golosov et al. 2014; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2019; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016)
;
also
Annex
III
.
Eco
nomic literature suggests applying risk
-
free, public, and long
-
term interest rates when evaluating
overall
climate
strategy
(Arrow et al. 2013; Groom and Hepburn 2017; Weitzman 2001; Dasgupta
2008)
. Expert elicitations indicate values around 2
% (majority) to
3%
(Drupp et al. 2018)
. This is
lower
than in many of the studies reviewed in earlier IPCC Assessments,
and many IAM studies since,
and
by
increasing the weight
accorded to the future
would increase current
‘optimal
effort
’
. The U.S.
Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon used 3% as its central value
(IAWG 2016;
Li and Pizer 2018; Adler et al. 2017)
.
Individual projects may require specific risk adjustments.
Distribution of impacts.
The economic damages
from climate change
at the nationally aggrega
ted and
subnational level
are very diverse
(Moore et al. 2017; Ricke et al. 2018; Carleton et al. 2020)
. A 'global
damage function’ necessarily implies aggregating impacts across people and countries with different
levels of income, and over generations, a process which obscures the strategic considerations that drive
climate policy making
(Keohane and Oppenheimer 2016)
. Economics acknowledges there is no single,
objectively
-
defined such ‘social welfare function’
(IPCC 1995, 2014a)
. This applies also to distribution
of responses; both
underlin
e
the relevance of equity (next section) and global negotiations to determine
national and
collective objectives.
