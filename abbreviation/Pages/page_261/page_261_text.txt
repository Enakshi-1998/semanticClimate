Chapter 1
IPCC
AR6 WGIII
AR6 emphasises that all pathways involve different challenges and require choices to be made.
Continuing ‘business as usual’ is still a
choice, which in addition to the obvious geophysical risks,
involves not making best use of new technologies, risks of future stranded assets, greater local pollution,
and multiple other environmental threats.
The dimensions as listed provide a basis for
this assessment both in the sectoral chapters (6
-
11)
,
providing a
common framework for cross
-
sectoral assessment
detailed further
in chapter 12
,
and in the
evaluation of global pathways
(
Section 3.2 in
C
hapter 3).

also illustrates varia

for evaluating domestic and
international policies
(Chapters 13 and 14)
.
The SR1.5 (
S
ection 4.4
in Chapter 4
) also introduced a
frame
work of ‘
Enabling Conditions for systemic change’
,
which as illustrated also has key dimensions
in common with those of our
feasibility
assessment
. In AR6 these
enabling conditions are applied
particularly in the context of shifting developments pathways (

.
Some fundamental criteria may span across several dimensions. Most obviously, issues of ethics and
equity are intrinsic to the economic, socio
-
cultural (values, including intergenerational justice) and
institutional (e.g., procedural justice
) dimensions. Geopolitical issues could also clearly involve several
dimensions, e.g., concerning the politics of international trade, finance and resource distribution
(economic dimension); international vs nationalistic identity (socio
-
cultural); and mul
tilateral
governance (institutional).
In this report, chapters with a strong demand
-
side dimension also suggest a simple policy hierarchy,
reflecting
that avoiding wastage
–
demands superfluous to human needs and wants
–
can carry benefits
across multiple
indicators. Consequently,
