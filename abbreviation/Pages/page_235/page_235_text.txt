C
onsumption is a habit
-
driven and social practice rather than simply a set of
individual decisions, making shifts in consumption harder to pursue
(Evans et al. 2012; Shove and Spurling
2
013; Kurz et al. 2015; Warde 2017; Verplanken and Whitmarsh 2021)
. Finally, shifts towards low
-
carbon
behaviour are also inhibited by social
-
psychological and political dynamics that cause individuals to ignore
the connections from daily consumption pra
ctices to climate change impacts
(Norgaard 2011; Brulle and
Norgaard 2019)
.
As a notable example,
plant
-
based alternatives to meat could
reduce
emissions from diets
(Willett et al.
2019; Eshel et al. 2019)
h
owever, diets are deeply entrenched in cultures and identities and hard
to change
(Fresco 2015; Mylan 2018)
.
Changing diets
a
lso raises
cross
-
cultural ethical issues,
in addition
to meat’s
role in providing nutrition
(Plumwoo
d 2004)
. Henceforth, some behaviours that are harder to change will
only be transformed by the transition itself: triggered by policies, the transition will bring about
technologies that, in turn, will entrench new sustainable behaviours.
Behaviour can
be
influenced
through a number of mechanisms besides economic policy and regulation,
such as information campaigns, advertising and
‘
nudging
’
.
I
nnovations and infrastructure
also
impact
behaviour
,
as with bicycle lanes
to reduce road traffic.
Wider
social innovations also have
indirect
impacts.
Education is increasing across the world, and higher education will have impacts on fertility, consumption
and the attitude towards the environment
(Osili and Long 2008; McCrary and Royer 2011; Hamilton 2011)
.
Reducing
poverty
and improvements
in health and
reproductive choice will also have implications for
fertility, energy use and consumption globally.
Finally, social capital and the ab
ility to work collectively
may have large consequences for mitigation and the ability to adapt to climate change
(Adger 2009; Section
4.3.5 in IPCC 2014a)
.
1.4.8
Policy
impacts
T
ransformation to different systems will hinge on conscious policy to change the direction in which energy,
land
-
use, agriculture
and other key sectors develop
(Bataille et al. 2016; Chapters 13, 16)
. Policy plays a
central role in in land
-
related systems
(C
hapter 7), urban development
(C
hapter 8), improving energy
efficiency in buildings
(C
hapter 9) and trans
port
/ mobility
(C
hapter 10), and decarbonising industrial
systems (
C
hapter 11).
Policy has been and will be central not only because greenhouse gas emissions are almost universally under
-
priced in market economies
(Stern and Stiglitz 2017; World Bank 2019)
, and because of inadequate
economic incentives to innovation
(Jaffe et al. 2005)
but also due to various delay m
echanisms
(Karlsson
and Gilek 2020)
and multipl
e sources of path
-
dependence and lock
-
in to existing systems (Section 1.8.2),
including “Infrastructure developments and long
-
lived products that lock societies into GHG
-
intensive
emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change, reinforcing th
e importance of early action
for ambitious mitigation
(robust evidence, high agreement)
.” (AR5 p.18).
Many hundreds of policies have been introduced explicitly to mitigate GHG emissions, improve energy
efficiency or land use, or to foster low carbon indu
stries and innovation, with demonstrable impact.
The
role of policy to date has been most evident in energy efficiency
(
Sections 5.4 and 5.6 in
C
hapter 5) and
electricity
(C
hapter 6). The IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy already found that “Governme
nt
policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies”,
(IPCC 2011a, p. 24)
.
Policy
packages since then have d
riven rapid
expansion
in renewables capacity and cost reductions (eg. through
the German
En
ergiewende
),
and
emission reductions from electricity (most dramatically with the halving
of CO
2
emissions from UK power sector, driven by multiple policy instruments and regulatory changes),
as detailed in
Chapter
6 (
S
ection 6.7.5).
