Mitigation and development pathways
While previous WG
III assessments have
explored
mitigation pathways
, since AR5 there has been an
increasing emphasis in the literature on
development pathways
, and in particular
at
the
national scale
.
Chapter 4 assesses ne

pathways
, complementing Chapter
3
which focusses on
long
-
term
pathways
(
up to 2100
).
While there
is considerable literature on country
-
level mitigation pathways, including but not limited to NDCs
, the c
ountry distribution of this literature
is very
unequal
(
high confidence
).

Mitigation and development pathwa
ys in the near
-
to mid
-
term
An emissions gap persists, exacerbated
by an implementation gap
, despite mitigation efforts
including those in nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
.
In this report t
he
emissions gap
i
s
understood as the difference between
projected
global
emissions with
national determined contributions
(
NDCs
)
in 2030, and
emissions in 2030 if
mitigation pathways consistent with the
Paris
temperature
goals
were
achieved
.
T
he term
implementation gap
refers to the gap between
NDC
mitigation pledges,
and the expected outcome of existing policies.

FOOTNOTE

Current NDCs refers to the most recent nationally determined contributions submitted to the
UNFCCC as well as those publicly announced (with sufficient detail on
targets, but not yet submitted) up to 11
October 2021, and reflected in literature published up to 11 October 2021
.
Original INDCs and NDCs refer to
those submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015 and 2016.
