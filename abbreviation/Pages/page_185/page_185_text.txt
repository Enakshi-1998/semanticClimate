TS. 6.4
Investment and finance
Finance to reduce net GHG emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts
is
a critical
enabling factor for the low carbon transition. Fundamental inequities in access to finance as well
as
finance
terms and conditions, and countries
’
exposure to physi
cal impacts of climate change
overall, result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition
(high confidence)
.
Decarbonising
the economy requires global action to address fundamental economic inequities and overcome the
climate investment trap that e
xists for many developing countries. For these countries the costs and
risks of financing often represent a significant challenge for stakeholders at all levels. This challenge is
exacerbated by these countries’ general economic vulnerability and indebtedn
ess. The rising public
fiscal costs of mitigation, and of adapting to climate shocks, is affecting many countries and worsening
public indebtedness and country credit ratings at a time when there were already significant stresses on
public finances. The CO
VID
-
19 pandemic has made these stresses worse and tightened public finances
still further. Other major challenges for commercial climate finance include: the mismatch between
capital and investment needs, home bias
23
considerations, differences in risk per
ceptions for regions, as
well as limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards are effective. (
high confidence
) {15.2, 15.6.3}
Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk.
This increased awareness can support climate policy development and implementation
(high
confidence)
.
{15.2, 15.6}
Climate
-
related financial risks arise fro
m physical impacts of climate change
(already relevant in the short term), and from a disorderly transition to a low carbon economy.
Awareness of these risks is increasing
,
leading also to concerns about financial stability. Financial
regulators and instit
utions have responded with multiple regulatory and voluntary initiatives to assess
and address these risks. Yet despite these initiatives, climate
-
related financial risks remain greatly
underestimated by financial institutions and markets
,
limiting the cap
ital reallocation needed for the
low
-
carbon transition. Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity
–
which act as a
barrier to the transformation
–
are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community. Stronger
steering by reg
ulators and policy makers has the potential to close this gap. Despite the increasing
attention of investors to climate change, there is limited evidence that this attention has directly
impacted emission reductions. This leaves high uncertainty, both near
-
term (2021
-
30) and longer
-
term
(2021
-
50), on the feasibility of an alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement
goals
(
high
confidence
). {15.2, 15.6}
Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow.
There
is a climate financing gap which reflects a persistent misallocation of global capital
(high
confidence
)
{15.2, 15.3}
.
Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil
-
fuel related financing
continue to be of major concern despite promising rece
nt commitments. This reflects policy
misalignment, the current perceived risk
-
return profile of fossil fuel
-
related investments, and political
economy constraints (
high confidence
). Estimates of climate finance flows
24
exhibit highly divergent
patterns acr
oss regions and sectors and a slowing growth {15.3}.
When the perceived risks are too high,
the misallocation of abundant
savings persists and investors refrain from investing in
infrastructure and
industry in search of safer financial assets, even earning low or negative real returns.

FOOTNOTE

Most of climate finance stays within national borders, especially private climate flows (over 90%).
The r
easons
for this range from
national policy support, differences in regulatory standards,
exchange rate,
political and governance risks, to information market failures.

limate finance flows refers to local, national, or transnational financing from public, private, and
alternative sources, to support mitigation and adaptation actio
