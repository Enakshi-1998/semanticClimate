off or both synergies and trade

offs exist between the SDG and
the mitigation option. Confidence levels are indicated through the solidity of the squares. A solid square
indicates high confidence, a partially
filled square indicates medium
confidence, and an outlined square
indicates low confidence.

Many of the potential trade
-
offs
between
mitigation
and
other sustainable development
outcomes
depend on policy design and can be compensated or avoided with additional policies and
investments
,
or through policies that integrate mitigation with other
SDGs
(high confidence)
.
Targeted SDG policies and investments, for example in the areas of
healthy nutrition, sustainable
consumption and production, and international collaboration, can support climate change mitigation
policies and resolve or alleviate trade
-
offs
.
Trade
-
offs can
also
be addressed by complementary policies
and investments, as
well as through the design of cross
-
sectoral policies integrating mitigation with the
SDGs
, and in particular:
good
health
and well
-
being
(SDG
3)
,
zero hunger and
nutrition
(SDG
2)
,
responsible
consumption and production
(SDG
12)
,
reduced
inequalities (SDG 10)
and
life on land
(SDG 15)
.

Decent living standards
,
which encompass
es
many SDG dimensions, are achievable at lower
energy use than previously thought (
high confidence
)
.
Mitigation strategies that foc
us on lower
ing
demand for energy and land
-
based resources exhibit reduced trade
-
offs and negative consequences for
sustainable development relative to pathways involving either high emissions and climate impacts or
pathways
with high consumption and emissi
ons that are ultimately
compensated by large quantities of
BECCS
. Figure TS.30
illustrates how
,
in the case of pathways
likely
limiting warming to 1.5°C,
sus
tainable development
policies can
lead to overall
benefits compared to mitigation policies
alone

The timing of mitigation actions and their effectiveness will have significant consequences for
broader sustainable development outcomes in the longer
term
(high confidence)
.
Ambitious
mitigation can be consi
dered a precondition for achieving the
SDGs

Adopting c
oordinated
cross
-
sectoral approaches to climate mitigation
can
target synergies and
minimi
s
e trade
-
offs
,
both
between sectors and
between
sustainable development
objectives
(
high
confidence
).
This requires integrated planning using multiple
-
objective
-
multiple
-
impact policy
frameworks. Strong inter
-
dependencies and cross
-
sectoral linkages create both opportunities for
synergies and need to address trade
-
offs related to mitigation op
tions and technologies. This can only
be done if coordinated sectoral approaches
to climate change mitigation policies
are adopted
that
mainstream these interactions
and ensur
e
local people are involved
in the development of new products,
as well as production and consumption practices.
For
instance
, t
here can be many synergies in urban
areas between mitigation policies and the SDGs but capturing these depends
on the overall planning of
urban structures a
nd on local integrated policies
such as
combin
ing
affordable housing and spatial
planning with walkable urban areas, green electrification and clean renewable energy
(medium
confidence
).
Integrated planning and cross
-
sectoral alignment of climate change po
licies are
also
particularly evident in developing countries’ NDCs under the Paris Agreement, where key priority
sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely aligned
with
the proposed mitigation and adaptation
actions and the SDGs
