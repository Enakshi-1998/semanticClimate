Historical contributions to cumulative net anthropogenic CO

emissions between 1850 and
2019 vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to

-LULUCF (760 +/- 220 GtCO

emissions.[FOOTNOTE 19] Globally, the major share of cumulative CO
2
-FFI emissions is
concentrated in a few regions, while cumulative CO
2
-LULUCF [FOOTNOTE 9] emissions are
concentrated in other regions. LDCs contributed less than 0.4% of historical cumulative CO

-FFI
emissions between 1850 and 2019, while SIDS contributed 0.5%. (

FOOTNOTE 9
: Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals
occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Currently, net CO

fluxes from land reported by global
book-keeping models used here are estimated to be about ~5.5 GtCO

higher than the aggregate
global net emissions based on national GHG inventories. This difference, which has been considered in
the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land
are defined. Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the
limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and
completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently
preferable. Even when the same methodological approach is applied, the large uncertainty of CO

-
LULUCF emissions can lead to substantial revisions to estimated emissions. {Cross-Chapter Box 3 in
Chapter 3, 7.2, SRCCL SPM A.3.3}

emissions from 1850-2019 are
reported using 68% confidence intervals.

In 2019, around 48% of the global population lives in countries emitting on average more than
6t CO
2
-eq per capita, excluding CO
2
-LULUCF. 35% live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO
2
-eq per
capita. Another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO
2
-eq per capita. A substantial share of the
population in these low emitting countries lack access to modern energy services (FOOTNOTE 20).
Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards (FOOTNOTE 21)
to all in these regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near-term,
can be achieved without significant global emissions growth. (

FOOTNOTE 20:
In this report, access to modern energy services is defined as access to clean, reliable
and affordable energy services for cooking and heating, lighting, communications, and productive uses
(See Annex I: Glossary)
FOOTNOTE 21:
In this report, decent living standards are defined as a set of minimum material
requirements essential for achieving basic human well-being, including nutrition, shelter, basic living
conditions, clothing, health care, education, and mobility. (See 5.1)
B.3.4
Globally, the 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34-45% of
global consumption-based household GHG emissions [
FOOTNOTE 22
], while the middle 40%
contribute 40-53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13-15%. (

FOOTNOTE 22:
Consumption-based emissions refer to emissions released to the atmosphere to
generate the goods and services consumed by a certain entity (e.g., a person, firm, country, or region).
