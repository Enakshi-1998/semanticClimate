Institutions entrench specific political decision

making processes, often empowering some interests over
others
, including
powerful interest groups who have vested interest in maintaining the current high carbon
economic structures

on the sub national and national go
vernance challenges including coordination, mediating politics and
strategy setting
.
Some suggest that societal transformation towards low a carbon future requires new politics that involves
thinking in intergenerational time horizons, as well as new form
s of partnerships between private and public
actors
(Westman and Broto 2018)
,
and associated
institutions and social innovation
s
to increase
involvement of non
-
state actors in climate governance
(Fuhr et al. 2018)
.
However literature is divided as
to how much
democratisation of climate politics, with greater emphasis on equity and community
par
ticipation
,
would
advance societal transformation in the face of climate change
(Stehr 20
05)
, or
may
actually hinder radical climate action in some circumstances
(Povitkina 2018)
.
Since 2016, the number of climate litigation cases has increased rapidly. UN Environment’s “
Global
Climate Litigation Report: 2020 Status Review”
(UNEP 2020)
noted t
hat between March 2017 and 1 July
2020, the number of cases nearly doubled with at least 1,550 climate cases filed in 8 countries. Several
important cases such as Urgenda Foundation v. The State of the Netherlands (“Urgenda”) and Juliana et al
v. United St
ates (“Juliana”) have had ripple effects, inspiring other similar cases
(Lin and Kysar 2020)
.
Numerous international climate governance initiatives engage national and subnational gov
ernments,
NGOs and private corporations, constituting a “regime complex”
(Keohane and Victor 2011; Raustiala and
Victor 2004)
. They may have longer
-
run and second
-
order effects if commitments are more precise and
binding
(Kahler 2017)
. However, without targets, incentives, defined baseline or monitoring, reporting, and
verificat
ion, they are not likely to fill the “mitigation gap”
(Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017)
.
1.4.10
International cooperation
Tackling
climate change is often mentioned as an important reason for strong international co
-
operat
ion in
the 21
st
century
(Bodansky et al. 2017; Cramton et al. 2017b; Keohane and Victor 2016; Falkner 2016)
.
M
itigation costs are borne by countries taking
action
,
while the benefit
s
of reduced climate change
are
not
limited to them
, being in economic terms “
global and non
-
excludable
”. Hence
anthropogenic climate
change
is typically seen as
a global commons pro
blem
(Wapner and Elver 2017; Falkner 2016)
. Moreover,
the belie
f
that
mitigation will raise energy cost
and
may
adversely affect competitiveness
creates
incentives
for free riding
,
where states
avoid
taking their fair share of action
(Barrett 2005; Keohane and Victor 2016)
.
International
cooperation has the potential to address these challenges
through
collective action
(Tulkens
,
2019
)
and
i
nternational institutions offer opportunity for act
ors to engage in meaningful communication,
and exchange of ideas about potential solutions
(Cole 2015)
.
International cooperation is
also
vital for the
creation and diffusion of norms and the framework for stabilising expectations among actors
(Pettenger
2016)
.
Some k
ey roles of the
UNFCCC
have been detailed by its former heads
(Kinley et al. 2021)
.
In addition to
specific agreements (most recently the PA) it
has
enhanced transparency through reporting a
nd data, and
generated or reinforced several important norms for global climate action including the principles of equity,
common but differentiated responsibility
and
respective capabilities
,
and the precautionary principles
for
maintaining
global coopera
tion among states with unevenly distributed emissions sources, climate impacts,
and varying mitigation cost across countries
(Keohane and Victor, 2016)
.
In addition to formal negotiations,
the annua
l Conference of Parties have

awareness
, and

more

through for example the formation of
