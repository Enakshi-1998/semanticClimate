Obvious limitations arise from the

(e

, with some

that agreement on

can never be expected

the combination of
improved damage functions
with the wider consensus on low
discount rates (as well as lower mitigation costs due to innovation) has increasingly yielded ‘optimal’
results from benefit

that extend the objective of the optimisation beyond traditional
welfare, adding some form of temperature targets as in
(Llavador et

represent
a step in bridging the gap between the two approaches and result in proposed strategies much more in
line with those coming from the cost

One review considered “the best estimate

still ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon

and

In addition to the

as noted
, on which some progress has been
made
,
some reviews
additionally
critique how IAMs represent abatement costs in terms of energy
efficiency and innovation
(e.g. Rosen and Guenther 2015; Farmer et al. 2015; Keen 2021)
; see also
1.7.3 and 1.7.4
. IAMs
may better reflect associated ‘rebound’ at system level
(Saunders et al. 2021)
,
and

(Homma et al. 2019)
; conversely,

(Karlsson et al. 2020)

complement global with additional local benefits
(see also

)
.
Whereas many of these factors affect primarily cost

benefit evaluation, discounting also determines the
cost

effective trajectory: Emmerling et a
l.
(2019)
find that, for a remaining budget of 1000GtCO

,
reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double current efforts, lim
it ‘overshoot’,
greatly reduce a late rush to negative emissions, and improve intergenerational justice by more evenly
distributing policy costs across the 21st century.
1.7.1.2
Dynamic efficiency
and uncertainty
Care is required to clarify what is optimised
(Dietz and Venmans 2019)
. Optimising a path towards a
given temperature goal
by a fixed date
(e.g. 2100) gives time
-
inconsistent results backloaded to large,
last
-
minute investment in
c
arbon dioxide removal
. ‘Cost
-
effective’ optimisations generate less initial
effort than
equivalent
cost
-
benefit models
(Gollier 2021; Dietz and Venmans 2019)
as they do not
incorporate benefits of reducing impacts earlier.
‘Efficient
pathways’ are affected by inertia and innovation. Inertia implies amplifying action on long
-
lived investments and infrastructure that could otherwise lock in emissions for many decades
(Vogt
-
Schilb et al. 2018; Baldwin et al. 2020)
.
Chapter 3 (section 3.5) discusses i
nteractions between
near,
medium and long
-
term actions in global pathways
, particularly
vis

-

inertia.
Also, t
o the extent that
early
action induces low carbon innovation, it ‘multiplies’ the optimal effort (for given damage
assumptions), because it facil

ates subsequent cheaper abatement. For example, a ‘learning
