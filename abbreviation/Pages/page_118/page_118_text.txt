The Transformation in Energy
Carriers: Electrification and Hydrogen
To use energy, it must be “carried” from where it was produced
–
at a power plant, for example, or a
refinery, or a coal mine
–
to where it is used. As countries reduce CO
2
emissions, they will need to
switch from gas
oline and other petroleum
-
based fuels, natural gas, coal, and electricity produced from
these fossil fuels to energy carriers with little or no carbon footprint. An important question is which
new energy carriers will emerge to support low
-
carbon transitio
ns.
Low
-
carbon energy systems
are expected to
rely heavily on end
-
use electrification, where electricity
produced
with
low GHG
emissions
is used for building and industrial heating, transport and other
applications that rely heavily on fossil fuels
at pre
sent
. But not all end
-
uses are
expected to
be
commercially electrifiable in the short to medium term {11.3.5}, and many will require low GHG liquid
and gaseous fuels, i.e., hydrogen, ammonia, and biogenic and synthetic low GHG hydrocarbons made
from low GH
G hydrogen, oxygen and carbon sources (the latter from CCU
16
, biomass, or direct air
capture {11.3.6}). The future role of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives will depend on how quickly
and how far production technology improves, i.e. from electrolysis (“gre
en”), biogasification, and fossil
fuel reforming with CCS (“blue”) sources. As a general rule, and across all sectors, it is more efficient
to use electricity directly and avoid the progressively larger conversion losses from producing hydrogen,
ammonia, o
r constructed low GHG hydrocarbons. What hydrogen does do, however, is add time and
space option value to electricity produced using variable clean sources, for use as hydrogen, as stored
future electricity via a fuel cell or turbine, or as an industrial f
eedstock. Furthermore, electrification and
hydrogen involve a symbiotic range of general
-
purpose technologies, such as electric motors, power
electronics, heat pumps, batteries, electrolysis, fuel cells etc., that have different applications across
sectors
but cumulative economies of innovation and production scale benefits. Finally, neither
electrification nor hydrogen produce local air pollutants at point of end
-
use.
For almost 140 years we have primarily produced electricity by burning coal, oil, and gas
to drive steam
turbines connected to electricity generators. When switching to low
-
carbon energy sources
–
renewable
sources, nuclear power, and fossil or bioenergy with CCS
–
electricity
is expected to
become a more
pervasive energy carrier. Electricity
is a versatile energy carrier, with much higher end
-
use efficiencies
than fuels, and it can be used directly to avoid conversion losses.
An increasing reliance on electricity from variable renewable sources, notably wind and solar power,
disrupts old conc
epts and makes many existing guidelines obsolete for power system planning, e.g.,
that specific generation types are needed for baseload, intermediate load, and peak load to follow and
meet demand. In future power systems with high shares of variable elect
ricity from renewable sources,
system planning and markets will focus more on demand flexibility, grid infrastructure and
interconnections, storage on various timelines (on the minute, hourly, overnight and seasonal scale),
and increased coupling between t
he energy sector and the building, transport and industrial sectors. This
shifts the focus to energy systems that can handle variable supply rather than always follow demand.
Hydrogen may prove valuable to improve the resilience of electricity systems with
high penetration of
variable renewable electricity. Flexible hydrogen electrolysis, hydrogen power plants and long
-
duration
hydrogen storage may all improve resilience. Electricity

efficiencies are projected to reach
up to 50% by 2030. {6.4.3}

capture and utili
s
ation
(CCU) refers to a process in which CO
2
is captured and the
carbon is then used in a product. The climate effect of CCU depends on the product lifetime, the product it
displaces, and the CO
2
source (fossil, biomass or atmosphere). CCU is sometimes referred to as Carbon Dioxide
Capture and Use,
or Carbon Capture and Utilisation.
