Strong differences remain in responsibilities for, and capabilities to, take climate action within and
between countries. These differences, as well as differences in the impact of climate change, point to
the
role of
collective action
in
achieving urgent and ambitious global climate mitigation in the context
of sustainable development
,
with attention to issues of equity and fairness as highlighted in several
chapters of the report (Chapters
4, 5, 14, 15, 17).
Innovation and industria
l development of key technologies in several relevant sectors have transformed
prospects for mitigation at much lower cost than previously assessed (Chapters 2 and 6
–
12). Large
reductions in the cost of widely
-
available renewable energy technologies, along
with
energy efficient
technologies and
behavioural changes (Chapters 5 and 9
–
11)
,
can enable societies to provide services
with
much
lower
emissions
. However, there are still significant differences in the ability to access and
utilise low carbon technolo
gies across the world (Chapter 4, 15, 16). New actors, including cities,
businesses, and numerous non
-
state transnational alliances have emerged as important players in the
global effort to tackle climate change (Chapters 13
–
16).
Along with continued deve
lopment of concepts, models and technologies, there have been numerous
insights from both the successes and failures of mitigation action that can inform future policy design
and climate action. However, to date, policies and investments are still clearly
inadequate to put the
world in line with the PA’s aims (Chapters 13, 15).
Th
e greater the inertia in emission trends
and carbon
-
intensive investments,
the more that CO
2
will
continue to accumulate
(Hilaire et al. 2019; IPCC 2019a)
.
Overall, the literature points to the need for
a more dynamic consideration of intertwined challenges concerning the transformation of key GHG
emitting syste
ms: to minimise the trade
-
offs, and maximise the synergies, of delivering deep
decarbonisation whilst enhancing sustainable development.

Chapter
introduces readers to the AR6 WGIII Report and provides an overview of progress
and
challenges, in
three
parts. Part A, introduces the climate mitigation challenge, provides key findings
and developments since previous assessment, and reviews the main drivers for, and constraints against
accelerated climate action. Part B provides an assessment of the key fra
meworks for understanding the
climate mitigation challenge covering broad approaches like sustainable development and more specific
economic, political and ethical framings. Part C
briefly
highlights the role of governance for steering
and coordinating eff
orts to accelerate globally effective and equitable climate mitigation, notes the gaps
in knowledge that have been identified in the process of assessment and provides a road map to the rest
of the Report

WGIII
IPCC Assessments have emphasised the importance of climate mitigation along with
the need to consider broader societal goals especially sustainable development.
Key insights from AR5
and the subsequent three Special Re
ports
(IPCC 2019b, 2018b, 2019c)
are summarised below.
AR5 projected that in baseline scenarios (i.e. based on prevailing trends without explicit additional
mitigation ef
forts), Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) would be the only sector
where emissions could fall by 2100, with some CO
2
removal
(IPCC 2014b, p. 17)
. Direct CO
2
emissions
from energy were projected to double or even triple by 2050
(IPCC 2014b, p. 20)
