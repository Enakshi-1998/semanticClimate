is then
not a static objective but a dy
namic framework for
measuring human progress
(Costanza et al. 2016; Fotis and Polemis 2018)
,
relevant for all countries
even if different groups of nations experience
the challenge of sustainability in different ways.
Much like

suggests
that
th

for realizing a climate

resilient and equitable world is enhanced
by
a process of transformation and development trajectories that seek to limit global warming while
also achieving the SDGS.
T

and long

requires continue

effort to keep the world along a climate resilient development path.
A key feature
of
development or transformation pathways that achieve a climate resilient world
is that they
maximise
the synerg

between climate mitigation and
other

goals

2017

.
Crucially,
the nature of trade

decisions will vary across countries depending on circumstances including the level of

Other concepts such as “Doughnut Economics”
(Raworth 2018)
, ecological modernisation, and
mainstreaming are also used to convey ideals of development pathways that take sustainability, climate
mitigation, and environmental limits seriously
