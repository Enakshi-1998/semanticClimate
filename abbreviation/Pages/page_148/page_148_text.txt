For context, the net flux due to the natural response of land to climate and environmental change is also
shown for CO

in column E. Positive values represent emissions, negative values represent removals.
Due to different approaches t

Estimates are given
for
2019 as this is the latest date when data are available for all gases, consistent with Chapter 2, this
report. Positive fluxes are emission from
land to the atmosphere. Negative fluxes are removals.
