They often
exert both push and pull forces at the same
time,
within
and across different scales
.
The development
and deployment of innovative technologies
and systems at scale are important for achieving deep decarbonisation. In recent years,
the cost of
several low carbon technologies has declined sharply, alongside rapid deployment. Over twenty
countries have also
sustained emission reductions
, and many more have accelerated energy efficiency
and/or land
-
use improvements. Overall, however
the global contribution is so far modest, at a few
billion tonnes (tCO
2
e) of avoided emissions annually

Accelerating mitigation to
prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with
in
the climate
system will require
the
integration of broadened assessment frameworks and tools that combine
multiple
perspectives, applied in a context of multi
-
level governance
(robust evidence, medium
agreement
)
.
Analysing a challenge on the scale of fully decarbonising our economies entail
s integration
of multiple analytic frameworks. Approaches to risk assessment and resilience, established across IPCC
Working Groups, are complemented by frameworks for probing the challenges in implementing
mitigation.
Aggregate Frameworks
include cost
-
eff
ectiveness analysis towards given objectives, and
cost
-
benefit analysis, both of which have been developing to take fuller account of advances in
understanding risks and innovation, the dynamics of emitting systems and of climate impacts, and
welfare econo
mic theory including growing consensus on long
-
term discounting.
Ethical frameworks
consider the fairness of processes and outcomes which can
help ameliorate
distributional impacts across
income groups, countries and generations.
Transition and transformat
ion frameworks
explain and
evaluate the dynamics of transitions to low
-
carbon systems
arising from interactions amongst levels,
with inevitable resistance from established socio
-
technical structures.
Psychological, behavioural
and
political frameworks
outline
the constraints (and opportunities) arising from human psychology and the
power o
f incumbent interests.
A comprehensive understanding
of climate mitigation
must
combine
these multiple frameworks.
Together with established risk frameworks, collectively
these help to
explain potential synergies and trade
-
offs
in mitigation
, imply a need
for a wide portfolio of policies
attuned to different actors and levels of decision
-
making, and underpin ‘just transition’ strategies in
diverse contexts
.

.
The speed, direction and depth of
any
transition will be determined
by choices in the
,
environmental, technological, economic, socio
-
cultural and institutional realms
(robust evidence,
high agreement)
.
Transitions
in specific systems
can be
gradual or rapid
and disruptive. The pace of
a
transi
tion can be impeded by ‘lock
-
in’
generated by
existing physical capital, institutions, and social
norms. The interaction between power, politics and economy is central in explaining why broad
commitment
s
do not always translate to urgent action. At the sam
e time, attention to and support for
climate policies and low carbon societal transition has generally increased
, as the impacts have become
more salient
.
Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and
balance of h
igh and low carbon investments. COVID
-
19 has strained public finances, and integrating
climate finance into ongoing recovery strategies, nationally and internationally, can accelerate the
diffusion of low carbon technologies and also help poorer countries
to minimise future stranded assets.
S
ocietal
& behavioural
norms
,
regulations and institutions
are essential
conditions
to accelerate low
carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major
transition
