market (‘tax or trading’) applications. A ’social cost of carbon’ can be used to evaluate government and
regulatory decisions, to compensate for inadequate carbon prices in actual
markets, and by companies
to reflect the external damage of their emissions and strategic risks of future carbon controls
(Zhou
and
Wen 2020)
. An agreed ‘social value of mitigation activities’ could form a basic index for underwriting
risks in low carbon investments internationally
(Hourcade et
al. 2021a)
.
Thus, practical assessment of carbon pricing inherently needs multi
-
dimensional analysis.
The realities
of political economy
and lobbying
have to date
severely
limited the implementation of carbon pricing
(Mildenberger 2020)
, leading some social scientists to ask ‘
Can
we
price carbon?’
(Rabe 2018)
.

(World Bank 2019)

“yes”, but only
through complex evolution of efforts
: a
study of 66 implemented carbon pricing policies show important effects of regional clustering,
international processes, and seizing politic
al windows of opportunity

Just Transitions.
Finally, whilst ‘transition’ frameworks may explain potential dynamics that could
transform systems, a multi

dimensional/multi
-
framework assessment underlines the
motivat
ion for
‘
just
transition
s’
(see subsection
1.6.2.3
in this chapter
and section
4.5 in
Chapter 4
)
.
This
can be defined as
a transition from a high
-
carbon to a low
-
carbon economy which is considered sufficiently equitable for
the affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries
(Jasanoff 2018; Newell
and Mulvaney 2013)
.
As noted
,
sufficient equity is not only an ethical issue but an enabler of deeper
ambition for accelerated mitigation
(Hoegh

Guldberg et al. 2019; Klinsky and Winkler 2018;
Urpelainen and Van de Graaf 201

P
erception of fairness influences the effectiveness of cooperative
action
(Winkler et al. 2018)
, and this can apply to affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors,
regions and countries
(Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Jasanoff 2018)
.
A

framing can also enable coalitions which integrate low carbon transformations with
concerns for climate adaptation
(Patterson et al. 2018)
. All this explains the emergence of ‘just transition
Commissions’ in several of the more ambitious developed countries and complex social packages for

Whilst the broad concepts of

Governing climate change
Previous sections have highlighted the multiple factors that
drive and constrain climate action, the
complex interconnection between climate mitigation and other societal objectives, and the diversity of
analytical frames for interpreting these connections. Despite the complexities, there are signs of
progress inclu
ding increased societal awareness, change in social attitudes, policy commitments by a
broad range of actors and sustained emission reductions in some jurisdictions. Nevertheless, emission
trends at the global level remains incompatible with the goals agre
ed in the Paris Agreement
.
Fundamentally, the challenge of how best to urgently scale up and speed
-
up the climate mitigation effort
at all scales
–
from local to global
–
to
the pace
needed to address the climate challenge is that of
governance understood a
s ‘modes and mechanisms to steer society
’
(Jorda
n et al. 2015)
. The concept
of governance encompasses the ability to plan and create the organisations needed to achieve a desired
goal
(Güney 201

and the process of interaction among actors involved in a common problem for
making and implementing decisions
(Hufty 2012; Kooiman 2003)
