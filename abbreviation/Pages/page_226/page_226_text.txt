Technologies:
Most striking, the cost of solar PV has fallen by a factor of 5
-
10 in the decade since the IPCC
Special Report on Renewable Energy
(IPCC 2011a)
and other data inputting
to the
AR5 assessments, The SR1.5 reported major cost reductions, the IEA (2020)
World Energy Outlook
described PV as now ‘the cheapest electricity in history’ for projects that ‘tap low cost finance and high
quality resources.’ Costs and deployment both vary wi
dely between different countries (chapter 6, 9, 12)
but costs are still projected to continue falling
(Vartiainen et al. 2020)
. Rapid technological developments
have occurred in many other low
-
carbon technologies including batteries and electric vehicles (see 1.4.3),
IT and related control systems, with progress als
o where electrification is not possible (Chapters 2, 6, 11)
Civil society pressures for stronger action.
Civic engagement increased leading up to the Paris Agreement
(Bäckstrand and Lövbrand 2019)
and after
.
Youth movements in several co
untries show young people’s
awareness about climate change, evidenced by the school strikes for the climate
(Hagedorn
et al. 2019;
Buettner 2020; Walker 2020; Thackeray et al. 2020)
. Senior figures across many religions
(Francis 2015;
IFEES 2015)
stressed
the duty of humanity to protect future generations and the natural world, and warned
about the inequities of climate change.
G
rowing awareness of local environmental problems such as air
pollution in Asia and Africa
(Karlsson et al. 2020)
, and the threat to indigenous people rig
hts and existence
has also
fuelled
climate activism
(Etchart 2017)
.
Grass
-
root movements
(Cheon and Urpelainen 2018;
Fisher et al. 2019)
, build
political pressure for acceler
ating climate change mitigation,
as does increasing
climate litigation
(Setzer and Vanhala 2019; Chapters 13 and 14)
.
Climate policies also encounter resistance.
However t
here
are multiple sources of
resistance to climate
action
in practice. C
orporations and trade
associations
often lobby against measures they deem detrimental
(
S
ection 1.4.6). T
he
emblematic
‘yellow vest’ movement in France
was triggered by higher fuel cost as a
result of
CO
2
tax
hike
(Lianos 2019; Driscoll 2021)
, though it
had broader aspect of income inequality and
other social issues
.
There is
often
mismatch between concerns on climate change
and people’s willingness
to pay for mitigation
. For example, whilst most
Americans believe climate change is happening, 68% said
in a survey
they would oppose climate policies that added just
USD
10/month to
electricity bills
(EPIC et
al. 2019)
, and worry about energy costs can eclipse those about climate change elsewhere
(Poortinga et al.
2018; Chapter 13)
.
Global trends contrary to multilateral cooperation.
S
tate
-
centred politics and geopolitical/geo
-
economic
tensions
seem to have become more prominent
across many countries a
nd issues
(WEF 2019)
. In some
cases, multilateral cooperation could be threatened by trends such as rising populism, nationalism,
authoritarianism and growing protectionism
(Abrahamsen et al. 2019)
, making
it more difficult to tackle
global challenges including protecting the environment
(Schreurs 2016; Parker et al. 2017; WEF 20
19)
.
Transnational alliances.
Partly countering this trend, c
ities, businesses, a wide range of other non
-
state
actors also have emerged with important international networks to foster mitigation. City
-
based examples
include the Cities Alliance in addressing climate change, Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, the Covena
nt of
Mayors (chapter 8); there are numerous other alliances and networks such as those in finance (chapter 15),
technology (chapter 16), amongst many others (chapters 13, 14).
Finally, under the Paris Agreement process, during 2020/21, many countries str
engthened their
Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs)
. I
ncluding updates until October 2021
, these would imply
global GHG
emissions
declining by 2030 to between 1
-
4% below 2019 levels (unconditional NDCs), or 4
-
10% (for
NDCs conditional on internation
al support)
, See
Table 4.3 in Chapter 4 )
.
This is a significant change but
would still not be
compatible with 1.5
°C
pathways, and e
ven
if delivered in full,
to
likely
stay below 2°C,
emissions would have to fall very rapidly after 2030
(
Section 3.2.5
)
