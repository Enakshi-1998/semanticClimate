category as defined in Box SPM.1. For emissions-related columns these values relate to the distribution of all
the pathways in that category. Harmonized emissions values are given for consistency with projected global
warming outcomes using climate emulators. Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WG I
(Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators are used for the probabilistic assessment of the resulting warming
of the pathways. For the ‘Temperature Change’ and ‘Likelihood’ columns, the single upper row values
represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the
warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges, the median
warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators
(MAGICC and FaIR). Subsequently, the 5th and 95th percentile values across all pathways for each emulator
are calculated. The coolest and warmest outcomes (i.e. the lowest p5 of two emulators, and the highest p95,
respectively) are shown in square brackets. These ranges therefore cover both the uncertainty of the emissions
pathways as well as the climate emulators’ uncertainty.

All global warming levels are relative to 1850–1900. See Table SPM 1 Footnote 13 below and SPM Scenarios
Box FOOTNOTE 46 for more details.

C3 pathways are sub-categorised according to the timing of policy action to match the emissions pathways in
Figure SPM.4. Two pathways derived from a cost-benefit analysis have been added to C3a, whilst 10 pathways
with specifically designed near-term action until 2030, whose emissions fall below those implied by NDCs
announced prior to COP26, are not included in either of the two subsets.

Alignment with the categories of the illustrative SSP scenarios considered in AR6 WG I, and the Illustrative
(Mitigation) Pathways (IPs/IMPs) of WG III. The IMPs have common features such as deep and rapid emissions
reductions, but also different combinations of sectoral mitigation strategies. See SPM Box 1 for an introduction
of the IPs and IMPs and Chapter 3 for full descriptions. {3.2, 3.3, Annex III.II.4}
6
The Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Neg’ has extensive use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the AFOLU,
energy and the industry sectors to achieve net negative emissions. Warming peaks around 2060 and declines to
below 1.5°C (50% likelihood) shortly after 2100. Whilst technically classified as C3, it strongly exhibits the
characteristics of C2 high overshoot pathways, hence it has been placed in the C2 category. See SPM C3.1 for
an introduction of the IPs and IMPs.

The 2019 range of harmonized GHG emissions across the pathways [53-58 GtCO
2
eq] is within the uncertainty
ranges of 2019 emissions assessed in Chapter 2 [53-66 GtCO
2
-eq]. {Fig SPM 1, Fig SPM 2, Box SPM1
FOOTNOTE 50}

Rates of global emission reduction in mitigation pathways are reported on a pathway-by-pathway basis
relative to harmonized modelled global emissions in 2019 rather than the global emissions reported in SPM
Section B and Chapter 2; this ensures internal consistency in assumptions about emission sources and activities,
as well as consistency with temperature projections based on the physical climate science assessment by WG I.
{Annex III.II.2.5, FOOTNOTE 50} Negative values (e.g., in C7, C8) represent an increase in emissions.

Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year
time-step data of the modelled pathways. Peak emissions (CO
2
and GHGs) are assessed for 5 year reporting
intervals starting in 2020. The interval 2020-2025 signifies that projected emissions peak as soon as possible
between 2020 and at latest before 2025. The upper 5-year interval refers to the median interval within which the
emissions peak or reach net zero. Ranges in square brackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways,
comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile 5-
year interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach specific milestones.
10
Percentiles reported across all pathways in that category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100
(fraction of pathways reaching net zero is given in round brackets). If the fraction of pathways that reach net
zero before 2100 is lower than the fraction of pathways covered by a percentile (e.g., 0.95 for the 95th
percentile), the percentile is not defined and denoted with "…". The fraction of pathways reaching net zero
includes all with reported non-harmonised, and / or harmonised emissions profiles that reach net zero. Pathways
were counted when at least one of the two profiles fell below 100 MtCO

yr

until 2100.

The timing of net zero is further discussed in SPM C2.4 and the Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3 on net
zero CO
2
and net zero GHG emissions.

For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a
Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO

-eq defined by the 100 year global warming potential. For each pathway,
reporting of CO
