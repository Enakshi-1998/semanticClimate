C.2.2
Modelled global pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot
involve more rapid and deeper near-term GHG emissions reductions through to 2030, and are projected
to have less net negative CO
2
emissions and less carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the longer term, than
pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot (C2 category). Modelled
pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) have on average lower net negative CO
2
emissions
compared to pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and pathways
that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot (C1 and C2 categories respectively).
Modelled pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot (C2 category) show
near-term GHG emissions reductions similar to pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (C3
category). For a given peak global warming level, greater and more rapid near-term GHG emissions
reductions are associated with later net zero CO
2
dates. (

Future non-CO
2
warming depends on reductions in non-CO
2
GHG, aerosol and their precursor,
and ozone precursor emissions. In modelled global low emission pathways, the projected reduction of
cooling and warming aerosol emissions over time leads to net warming in the near- to mid-term. In
these mitigation pathways, the projected reductions of cooling aerosols are mostly due to reduced fossil
fuel combustion that was not equipped with effective air pollution controls. Non-CO
2
GHG emissions
at the time of net zero CO
2
are projected to be of similar magnitude in modelled pathways that limit
warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. These non-CO
2
GHG emissions are about 8 [5–11] GtCO

-eq per
year, with the largest fraction from CH
4
(60% [55–80%]), followed by N
2
O (30% [20–35%]) and F-
gases (3% [2–20%]). [FOOTNOTE 52] Due to the short lifetime of CH
4
in the atmosphere, projected
deep reduction of CH
4
emissions up until the time of net zero CO
2
in modelled mitigation pathways
effectively reduces peak global warming. (

GHG emissions. Typical emissions pathways that reach and sustain global
net zero GHG emissions based on the 100 year global warming potential (GWP100) [FOOTNOTE 7]
are projected to result in a gradual decline of global warming. About half of the assessed pathways that
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (C1 category) reach net zero GHG
emissions during the second half of the 21
st
century. These pathways show greater reduction in global
warming after the peak to 1.2 [1.1-1.4]°C by 2100 than modelled pathways in the same category that
