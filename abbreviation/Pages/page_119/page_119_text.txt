Technical Summary
IPCC
AR6 WG III
Electrification is
expected
to be the dominant strategy in buildings as electricity is increasingly used for
heating and for cooking. Electricity will help to integrate renewable energy into buildings and will also
lead to more flexible demand for heating, cooling, and electricity. D
istrict heating and cooling offers
potential for demand flexibility through energy storage and supply flexibility through cogeneration.
Heat
pumps
are increasingly used in buildings and industry for
heating and cooling {9.

.
The ease of switchi
ng to electricity means that hydrogen is
not expected
to be a dominant pathway for
buildings
{
Box 9.6}
. Using electricity directly for heating, cooling and other building energy demand
is more efficient than using hydrogen as a fuel, for example, in boiler
s or fuel cells. In addition,
electricity distribution is already well developed in many regions compared to essentially non
-
existent
hydrogen infrastructure, except for a few chemicals industry pipelines. At the same time, hydrogen
could potentially be us
ed for on
-
site storage should technology advance sufficiently.
Electrification is already occurring in several modes of personal and light freight transport, and vehicle

to
-
grid solutions for flexibility have been extensively explored in the literature and
small
-
scale pilots.
The role of hydrogen in transport depends on how far technology develops. Batteries are currently a
more attractive option than hydrogen and fuel
-
cells for light
-
duty vehicles. Hydrogen and hydrogen
-
derived synthetic fuels, such as amm
onia and methanol, may have a more important role in heavy
vehicles, shipping, and aviation
{10.3}
.
Current transport of fossil fuels may be replaced by future
transport of hydrogen and hydrogen carriers such as ammonia and methanol, or energy intensive ba
sic
materials processed with hydrogen (e.g. reduced iron) in regions with bountiful renewable resources.
{Box 11.1}
Both light and heavy industry are potentially large and flexible users of electricity for both final energy
use (e.g., directly and using he
at pumps in light industry) and for feedstocks (e.g., hydrogen for
steel
making and chemicals). For example, industrial process heat demand,
ranging
from below 100
°C
to
above 1000
°C
, can be
met through a wide range of electrically powered technologies ins
tead of using
fuels. Future demand for hydrogen (e.g., for nitrogen fertili
s
er or as reduction agent in steel production)
also offers electricity demand flexibility for electrolysis through hydrogen storage and flexible
production cycles
{11.3.5}
.
The main
use of hydrogen and hydrogen carriers in industry is
expected
to
be as feedstock (e.g., for ammonia and organic chemicals) rather than for energy as industrial
electrification increases.

Nuclear power and hydropower are already established technologies. Solar PV and wind
are now cheaper than fossil
-
generated electricity in many locations. Bioenergy accounts for about a
t
enth of global primary energy. Carbon capture is widely used in the oil and gas industry, with early
applications in electricity production and biofuels. It will not be possible to widely deploy all of these
and other options without efforts to address the
geophysical, environmental

ecological, economic,
technological, socio

cultural, and institutional factors that can facilitate or hinder their implementation.
