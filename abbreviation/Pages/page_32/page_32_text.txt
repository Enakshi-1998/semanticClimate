2100. In modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (C3 category), there is no significant
difference in warming by 2100 between those pathways that reach net zero GHGs (around 30%) and
those that do not (

All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited
overshoot, and those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) involve rapid and deep and in most cases
immediate GHG emission reductions in all sectors. Modelled mitigation strategies to achieve these
reductions include transitioning from fossil fuels without CCS to very low- or zero-carbon energy
sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand side measures and improving
efficiency, reducing non-CO
2
emissions, and deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods
to counterbalance residual GHG emissions. Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) show
different combinations of sectoral mitigation strategies consistent with a given warming level.

There is a variation in the contributions of different sectors in modelled mitigation pathways,
as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways. However, modelled pathways that limit warming
to 2°C (>67%) or lower share common characteristics, including rapid and deep GHG emission
reductions. Doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if
warming is to be limited. (

In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, the
global use of coal, oil and gas in 2050 is projected to decline with median values of about 95%, 60%
and 45% compared to 2019. The interquartile ranges are (80 to 100%), (40 to 75%) and (20 to 60%)
and the p5-p95 ranges are [60 to 100%], [25 to 90%] and [-30 to 85%], respectively. In modelled
pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), these projected declines have a median value and
interquartile range of 85% (65 to 95%), 30% (15 to 50%) and 15% (-10 to 40%) respectively by 2050.
The use of coal, oil and gas without CCS in modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%)
with no or limited overshoot is projected to be reduced to a greater degree, with median values of about
100%, 60% and 70% in 2050 compared to 2019. The interquartile ranges are (95 to 100%), (45 to 75%)
and (60 to 80%) and the p5-p95 range of about [85 to 100%], [25 to 90%], and [35 to 90%] for coal, oil
and gas respectively. In these global modelled pathways, in 2050 almost all electricity is supplied from
zero or low-carbon sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, combined with increased
electrification of energy demand. As indicated by the ranges, choices in one sector can be compensated
for by choices in another while being consistent with assessed warming levels. [FOOTNOTE 53] (

In modelled pathways that reach global net zero CO
2
emissions, at the point they reach net
zero, 5-16 GtCO
2
of emissions from some sectors are compensated for by net negative CO
2
emissions
in other sectors. In most global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, the
AFOLU sector, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and the energy supply sector reach net zero
CO
2
emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. (
