how
such

associated analytic frameworks,
can
shed light on a few key issues which arise across many chapters of
this assessment.

The continued rise of global emissions reflects in part the strongly

An
interdisciplinary review
(Seto et al. 2016)
identifies a dozen main components organised into
four
types,
across the relevant Dimensions of Assessment as
summarised in
