: Returning to below 1.5°C in 2100 from GHG emissions levels in 2030 associated
with the implementation of NDCs is infeasible for some models due to model-specific constraints on
the deployment of mitigation technologies and the availability of net negative CO

emissions.
Figure SPM.4: Global GHG emissions of modelled pathways (funnels in Panel a. and associated bars in
Panels b, c, d) and projected emission outcomes from near-term policy assessments for 2030 (Panel b).
Panel a
shows global GHG emissions over 2015-2050 for
four types of assessed modelled global pathways:
●
Trend from implemented policies: Pathways with projected near-term GHG emissions in line with
policies implemented until the end of 2020 and extended with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030
(29 scenarios across categories C5-C7, Table SPM.1)
●
Limit to 2°C (>67%) or return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030:
Pathways with GHG emissions until 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced
prior to COP26, followed by accelerated emissions reductions
likely
to limit warming to 2°C (C3b,
Table SPM.1) or to return warming to 1.5°C with a probability of 50% or greater after high overshoot
(subset of 42 scenarios from C2, Table SPM.1).
