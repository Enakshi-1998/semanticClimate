missions are driven

by the large rise in demand for basic materials and manufactured products, a global trend of increasing

:
Direct emissions estimates assign emissions to the sector in which they arise (scope 1
reporting). Indirect emissions
–
as used here
-
refer to the reallocation of emissions from electricity and heat to
the sector of final use (scope 2 reporting). Note tha
t cement refers to process emissions only, as a lack of data
prevents the full reallocation of indirect emissions to this sector. More comprehensive conceptualisations of
indirect emissions including all products and services (scope 3 reporting) are discus
sed in
Chapter
2 s
ection 2.3.
Emissions are converted into CO

equivalents based on global warming potentials with a

Providing
access to modern energy services
universally
would increase global GHG emissions by
a few percent
at most
(
high confidence)
.

for all is estimated to be well below current average energy consumption (
medium
evidence, high agreement
). More equitable income distribution
could
also
reduce carbon
