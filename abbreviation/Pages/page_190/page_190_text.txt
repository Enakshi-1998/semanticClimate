Innovation, technology development and transfer
Innovation in climate mitigation technologies has seen enormous activity and significant progress
in recent years. Innovation has also led to, and exacerbated, trade
-
offs in relation to sustainable
development.
Innovation can leverage action to mitigate cl
imate change by reinforcing other
interventions. In conjunction with other enabling conditions innovation can support system transitions
to limit warming and help shift development pathways. The currently widespread implementation of
solar PV and
LED
l
ight
ing
, for instance, could not have happened without technological innovation
.
Technological innovation can also bring about new and improved ways of delivering services that are
essential to human well

(
high confidence
) {16.1, 16.3, 16.4, 16.6}
.
At th
e same time as delivering
benefits, innovation can result in trade
-
offs that undermine both progress on mitigation and progress
towards other sustainable development goals. Trade
-
offs include negative externalities
–
for instance
greater environmental poll
ution and social inequalities
–
rebound effects leading to lower net emission
reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and
providers
(high confidence)
. Effective governance and policy ha
ve
the potential to av
oid and minimise
such misalignments (
medium evidence, high agreement
). {16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5.1, 16.6}
A systemic view of innovation to direct and organize the processes has grown over the last decade.
This systemic view of innovation takes into account
the role of actors, institutions, and their
interactions and can inform how
innovation systems
that vary across technologies, sectors and
countries, can be strengthened (
high confidence)
{16.2, 16.3, 16.5}
.
Where a
systemic view of
innovation has been taken, it has enabled the development and implementation of indicators that are
better able to provide insights in innovation processes. This, in turn, has enabled the analysis and
strengthening of innovation systems. T
raditional quantitative innovation indicators mainly include
R&D investments and patents.

illustrates
that
energy

related RD&D
has risen slowly in
the last two decades, and that there has been a reorientation of the portfolio of funded energy
technologie
s
.
Systemic indicators of innovation, however, go well beyond these approaches.
They
include structural innovation system elements including actors and networks, as well as indicators for
how innovation systems function, such as access to financ
e, employment in relevant sectors, and
lobbying activities {16.3.4, Table 16.7}. For example, in Latin America, monitoring systemic
innovation indicators for the effectiveness of agroecological mitigation approaches has provided
insights on the appropriate
ness and social alignment of new technologies and practices {Box 16.5}.

economy models, including integrated assessment models, generally employ a stylised
and necessarily incomplete view of innovation, and have yet to incorporate a systemic
representation
of innovation systems
