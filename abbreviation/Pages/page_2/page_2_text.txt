The Working Group III (WG III) contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) assesses
literature on the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and social aspects of mitigation of
climate change.
[FOOTNOTE 1] Levels of confidence
[FOOTNOTE 2] are given in () brackets.
Numerical ranges are presented in square [] brackets. References to Chapters, Sections, Figures and
Boxes in the underlying report and Technical Summary (TS) are given in {} brackets.
FOOTNOTE 1:
The Report covers literature accepted for publication by 11 October 2021.
FOOTNOTE 2:
Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A
level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers, typeset in italics:
very low
,
low
,
medium
,
high
and
very high
. The assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result is described as: virtually certain 99–100%
probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not 50–100%, about as likely as
not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms
may also be used when appropriate, consistent with the IPCC uncertainty guidance:

.
The report reflects new findings in the relevant literature and builds on previous IPCC reports, including
the WG III contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the WG I and WG II
contributions to AR6 and the three Special Reports in the Sixth Assessment cycle,
[FOOTNOTE 3] as
well as other UN assessments. Some of the main developments relevant for this report include {TS.1,
TS.2}:
FOOTNOTE 3:
The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C: an IPCC Special Report on
the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas
emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change,
sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (2018); Climate Change and Land: an IPCC
Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019); IPCC Special Report on the Ocean
and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019).
•
An evolving international landscape.
The literature reflects, among other factors: developments
in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, including the outcomes
of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the Paris Agreement {13, 14, 15, 16}; the UN 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) {1, 3,
4, 17}; and the evolving roles of international cooperation {14}, finance {15} and innovation {16}.
•
Increasing diversity of actors and approaches to mitigation.
Recent literature highlights the
growing role of non-state and sub-national actors including cities, businesses, Indigenous Peoples,
citizens including local communities and youth, transnational initiatives, and public-private entities
in the global effort to address climate change {5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}. Literature documents the
global spread of climate policies and cost declines of existing and emerging low emission
technologies, along with varied types and levels of mitigation efforts, and sustained reductions in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in some countries {2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16}, and the impacts of,
and some lessons from, the COVID-19 pandemic. {1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 15, Box TS.1, Cross-Chapter Box
