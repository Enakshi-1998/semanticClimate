Box TS.2: GHG emission metrics
provide simplified information about the effect
s of different
greenhouse gases
Comprehensive mitigation policy relies on consideration of all anthropogenic forcing agents, which
differ widely in their atmospheric lifetimes and impacts on the climate system.
GHG emission metrics
provide simplified information about the effect that emi
ssions of different gases have on global
temperature or other aspects of climate, usually expressed relative to the effect of emitting
CO
2
ǂ
. This
information can support choices about priorities, trade
-
offs and synergies in mitigation policies and
emission
targets for
non
-
CO
2
gases
relative to CO
2
as well as baskets of gases expressed in CO
2
-
eq
.
The choice of metric
can affect the timing and emphasis placed on reducing emissions of Short
-
Lived
Climate Forcers (SLCFs) relative to CO
2
within multi
-
gas abatem
ent strategies as well as the costs of
such strategies. Different metric choices can also alter the time at which net
zero GHG emissions are
calculated to be reached for any given emissions scenario.
A wide range of GHG emission metrics has
been published
in the scientific literature, which differ in terms of: (i) the key measure of climate change
they consider, (ii) whether they consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated
over a specified time horizon, (iii) the time horizon over
which the metric is applied, (iv) whether they
apply to a single emission pulse, to emissions sustained over a period of time, or to a combination of
both, and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission compared to the absence of that
em
ission, or compared to a reference emissions level or climate state

Annex I
}
.
Parties to the Paris Agreement decided to report aggregated emissions and removals (expressed as CO
2
-
eq) based on the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100
years (GWP
100
) using values
from IPCC AR5 or from a subsequent IPCC report as agreed upon by the CMA
†
, and to account for
future nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in accordance with this approach. Parties may also
report supplemental
information on aggregate emissions and removals, expressed as CO
2
-
eq, using
other GHG emission metrics
assessed by the IPCC
.
The WG
III contribution to AR6
uses updated GWP
100
values from AR6 WG I to
report aggregate
emissions and removals unless stated o
therwise. These reflect updated scientific understanding of the
response of the climate system to emissions of different gases and include a methodological update to
incorporate climate
-
carbon cycle feedbacks associated with the emission of non
-
CO
2
gases (
see Annex
II Part II Section 8
for a list of GWP
100
metric values)
.
The choice of GWP
100
was made
inter alia for
consistency with decisions under the
Rulebook for
the Paris Agreement and because it is the dominant
metric used in the literature
assessed by WG
III. Furthermore, for mitigation pathways that
likely
limit
global
warming to 2°C or lower, using GWP
100
