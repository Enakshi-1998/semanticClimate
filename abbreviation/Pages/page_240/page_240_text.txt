closely related to cumulative CO

the remaining ‘carbon budget’
for a given warming depends strongly
inter alia
on emissions of other GHGs; for targets below 2°C this

Pathways and ‘net zero’
.
The date at which the world needs aggregate emissions to reach net zero for Paris
-
consistent temperature goals depends both on progress in reducing non

CO
2
GHG emissions and near
-
term
progress in reducing CO
2
emissions. Faster progress in the near term extends the date at which
net zero
must be reached, while conversely, slower near
-
term progress brings the date even closer to the present.
Some of the modelled 1.5°C pathways with
limited
overshoot cut global CO
2
emissions in half until 2030,
which allows for a more gradual decline th
ereafter, reaching net zero
CO

after 2050
; also,
net zero

occurs later, with remaining emissions of some non

Drawing
from

f
ive
Illustrative Mitigation Pathways’ (IMPs)
were defined for this
report
(
Figure
3.5 in Chapter 3 and
Table 1.1
)
.
These are introduced here, with a more complete description
and discussion provided in
Section 3.2.5
of
Chapter 3. These IMPs were chosen to illustrate key themes
with respect to mitigation strategies across the entire WG III assessment. The IMPs embody b
oth a storyline,
which describes in narrative form the key socio
-
economic characteristics of that scenario, and a quantitative
illustration providing numerical values that are internally consistent and comparable across chapters of this
report. Quantitativ
e IMPs can be associated directly with specific human activities and provide a
quantitative point of reference that links activities in different parts of socioeconomic systems.
Some parts
of the report draw on these quantitative scenarios, whilst others u
se only the narratives
. No assessment of
the likelihood of each IMP has been made (as they reflect both human choice and deep uncertainty).
