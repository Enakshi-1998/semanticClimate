Political economy
The politics of interest (most especially economic interest) of key actors at subnational,
national and global
level can be important determinants of climate (in)action
(O’Hara 2009; Lo 2010; Tanner and Allouche
2011; Sovacool et al.
2015; Clapp et al. 2018; Lohmann 2017; Newell and Taylor 2018; Lohmann 2019)
.
Political economy approaches can be crudely divided into “economic approaches to politics”, and those
used
by other social scientists
(Paterson and P‐Laberge 2018)
.
The former shows how electoral concerns
lead to weak treati
es
(Battaglini and Har
stad 2016)
and when policy negotiations cause status
-
quo biases
and the use of inefficient policy instruments
(Austen
-
Smith et al. 2019)
or delays and excessive
harmonization
(Harstad 200
7)
.
The latter emphasises the central role of structures of power, production,
and a commitment to economic growth and capital accumulation in
relation to
climate action
, given t
he
historically central role of fossil fuels to economic development
and
th
e deep embedding of fossil energy
in daily life
(Malm 2015; Huber 2012; Di Muzio 2015; Newell and Paterson 2010)
.
The
economic
centrality of fossil
fuels
raises obvious questions regarding the possibility of decarbonisation.
Economically, this is well understood as a problem of decoupling. But the constraint is also political, in
terms of the power of incumbent fossil fuel interests to block initiatives tow
ards decarbonisation
(Newell
and Paterson 2010; Geels 2014; Jones and Levy 2009)
.
T
he effe
cts of
climate
policy are key considerations
in deciding the level of policy ambition and direction and strategies of states
(Alam et al. 2013; Ibikunle
and Okereke 2014; Lo 2010)
, regions
(Goldthau and Sitter 2015)
; and business actors
(Wittneben et al.
2012)
and there is a widespread cultural assumption that continued fossil fuel use is central to this
(Strambo
and Espinosa 2020)
. Decarbonisation strategies are often centred around projects to develop new sources
of economic activity: carbon markets creating new commodities to
trade profit from
(Newell and Paterson
2010)
; the investment generated in new urban infrastructure
(Whitehead 2013)
; innovations in a range of
new energy technologies
(Fankhauser et al. 2013; Lachapelle et al. 2017; Meckling and Nah
m 2018)
.
One factor limiting the ambition of climate policy has been the ability of incumbent industries to shape
government action on climate change
(Newell and Paterson
1998; Breetz et al. 2018; Jones and Levy 2009;
Geels 2014)
. Incumbent industries are often more concentrated than those benefiting from climate policy
and lobby more effectively to prevent losses than those who would gain
(Meng and Rode 2019)
.
Drawing
upon wider networks
(Brulle 2014)
,
c
ampaigns by oil and coal companies against climate action in the US
and Australia are perhaps the most well
-
kn
own and largely successful of these
(Brulle et al. 2020; Stokes
2020; Mildenberger 2020; Pearse 2017)
although similar dynamics have been demonstrated for example in
Brazil and South Africa
(Hochste
tler 2020)
,
Canada
(Harrison 2018)
, Norway
, or Germany
(Fitzgerald et
al. 2019)
. In other contexts, resistance by incumbent companies is more subtle but
nevertheless has
weakened policy design on emissions trading systems
(Rosembloom an
d Markard 2020)
,
and
limited the
development of alternative fuelled automobiles
(Wells and Nieuwenhuis 2012; Levy and Egan 2003)
.
The interaction of politics, power and economics is central in explaining why countries with higher
per
-
capita emissions, which logically have more opportunities to reduce emissions, in practice often take the
opposite stance, and conversely, why some low
-
emitting countries may find it easier to pursue climate
action because they have fewer vested intere
sts in high
-
carbon economies. These dynamics can arise from
the vested interest of State
-
owned Enterprises
(Polman 2015; Wright and Nyberg 2017; Wittneben et al.
2012)
, the alignment and coalitions of countrie
s in climate negotiations
(Gupta 2016; Okereke and Coventry
2016)
, and the patterns of opposition to or support for climate policy among citizens
(Swilling et al. 2016;
Ransan
-
Cooper et al. 2018; Turhan et al. 2019; Baker 2015; Heffron and McCauley 2018)
