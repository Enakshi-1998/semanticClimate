III
Well
-
designed and effectively i
mplemented mitigation actions in the buildings sector have
significant
potential
to help achieve
the
SDGs
(
high confidence
).
As shown in Figure TS.16, t
he
impacts of mitigation actions in the building sector go far beyond the goal of climate action (SDG13)
and contribute to meeting
fifteen o
ther SDGs. Mitigation actions in the building sector bring health
gains through improved indoor air quality and ther
mal comfort
,
and
ha
ve
positive
significant macro
-
and micro
-
economic effects, such as increased productivity of labour, job creation, reduced poverty,
especially energy poverty, and improved energy security (

The
COVID

19
pandemic
emphasised the importance of buildings for human well
-
being and
highlighted
the inequalities in access for all to suit
able
,
healthy buildings, which provide natural
daylight and clean air to their occupants (
medium confidence
)
.
The new WHO health
recommendations emphasised indoor air quality, preventive maintenance of centralised mechanical
heating, ventilation, and cooli
ng systems.
There are opportunities for r
epurposing existing non
-
residential buildings, no longer in use due to the expected spread of teleworking triggered by the health
crisis and enabled by digitali
s
ation
