The landscape of transitions to sustainable development is changing rapidly, with
multiple
transitions already underway. This creates the room to manage these transitions in ways that
prioritise the needs
of
workers in vulnerable sectors (
e.g.
,
land, energy) to secure their jobs and
maintain secure and healthy
lifestyles
(
medium eviden
ce, high agreement)
.
{17.3.2}
Actions aligning sustainable development
,
climate mitigation and partnerships can support
transitions. Strengthening different stakeholders’ “response capacities” to mitigate and adapt to
a changing climate will be critical for a sustainable transition
(
high confidence
