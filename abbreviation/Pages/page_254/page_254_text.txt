e deemed vital to counteract tendenc
ies
to
‘

’
,
and to achieve
behavioural changes
often
associated with
tackl
ing
climate change
(
Section 5.2.1
in
Chapter 5)
.
Some literature suggests that attention
to emotion
s
,
especially with regards to climate communication
,
could
help societies and individuals act in ways that focus less on monetary gain and more on
climate
and
environmental sustainability
(Bryck and Ellis 2016; Chapman et al. 2017; Nabi et al. 2018; Zummo
et al. 2020)

1.7.2.2
Equity and representat
ion: international public choice across time and space
Equity perspectives highlight three asymmetries relevant for climate change
(Okereke 2017; Okereke
and Coventry 2016; 1.4.6)
.
A
symmetry in contribution
highlights different contributions to climate
change both in historical and current terms, and apply both within and between states as well as between
generations
(Caney 2016; Heyward and Roser 2016)
.
Asymmetry in impacts
highlight the fact
that the
damages will be borne disproportionately across countries, regions, communities, individuals and
gender; moreover, it is often those that have contributed the least that stand to bear the greatest impact
of climate change
(Shi et al. 2016; IPCC 2014a)
.
Asymmetry in capacity
highlights differences of power
between groups and nations to participate in climate decision and governance
, including capacity to
implement mitigation and adaptation measure
s
.
If attention is not paid to equity, efforts designed to tackle climate change may end up exacerbating
inequities among communities and between countries
(Heffron and McCauley 2018)
. The implication
is that to be sustainable in the long run, mitigation
involves
a central place for consideration of justice
,
both within and betwe
en countries
(
C
hapter
s 4,
14)
.
Arguments
that
the
injustice
s
following from
climate
change are
sympto
ma
tic of a more fundamental structural injustice
in
social relations
, are taken
to imply a need
to address the deeper inequities within societies
(Routl
edge et al. 2018)
.
Climate change and climate policies affect countries and people differently, with the poor likely to be
more affected (1.6.1). Ideas of ‘just transition’ (outlined in 1.8.2.) often have a national focus in the
literature, but also imp
ly that mitigation should not increase the asymmetries between rich and poor
countries, implying a desire for transitions which seek reduce (or at least avoid adverse) distributional
affects. Thus, it comes into play in the timing of zero emissions (chapte
r 3 and 14). International climate
finance in which rich countries finance mitigation and adaptation in poor countries is also essential for
reducing the asymmetries between rich and poor countries (1.

and chapter 15).
Equit
y
across generations also mat
ters, i.e., the distribution between the present and future generations.
One aspect is discounting (1.7.1)
. Another approach has been to study the burdens on each generation
following from the transition to low

carbon economies
(IPCC 2014a chapter 3
,

Working Group

in Chapter 12
)
.
Suggestions include shifting
more
investments in
to
‘
natural capital
’,
so that future
generations will inherit less
physical
capital but a better environment, or financing mitigation efforts
today using governmental debt redeemed by future generations
(Broome 2012; Heijdra et al. 2006; Karp
and Rezai 2014; Hoel et al. 2019)
.
