AR6 WGIII
Emissions
per unit GDP
are much less diverse than per
-
capita, and have also converged significantly.
Poorer countries tend to show higher energy/ emissions per unit GDP partly because of higher reliance on
basic industries, and this remains the case, though in general their ene
rgy/GDP has declined faster.
Many
developed country regions
are net importers of
energy
-
intensive goods
, and emissions are affected
by the accounting of such ‘embodied emissions’
. Panels (c) and (d) show results (only available
for
CO
2
,
to 2018)
on the basis of consumption
-
footprints which include emissions embodied in traded goods
. This
make
s
modest changes to
the relative position of different regions (for further discussion see
Chapter 2).

GHG emissions are categorised into: Fossil fuel and industry (CO

FFI), Land use, land use change, forestry
(CO

LULUCF) and other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, Fgas

-
FFI emissions per unit

-
based accounting (panel d). The area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions
for each regional category, with the height capturing per

capita emissions (panels a and c) or emissions pe

unit GDPppp (panels b and d), and the width proportional to the population of the regions and GDPppp.
Emissions from international aviation and shipping (2.4% of the total GHG emissions) are not included.
