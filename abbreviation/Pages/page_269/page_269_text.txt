Chapter 1
IPCC
AR6 WGIII
(
5
)
, a new chapter for IPCC Assessments, focuses upon the role of services and derived demand for
energy and land use, and the social dimensions.
Chapters 6
-
12 examine sectoral contributions and possib
ilities for mitigation
. (
6
)
summarises
characteristics and trends in the energy sector, specifically supply, including the remarkable changes in
the cost of
some key technologies since AR5;
(
7
)
examines the roles of AFOLU, drawing upon and
updating the rec
ent Special Report, including the potential tensions be
tween the multiple uses of land;
(
8
)
presents a holistic view of the trends and pressures of urban systems, as both a challenge and an
opportunity for mitigation
;
Chapters 9 and 10 then examine two sec
tors which entwine with, but go
well beyond, urban systems: buildings
(
9
)
including construction materials and zero carbon buildings;
and transport
(
10
)
, including shipping and aviation and a wider look a
t mobility as a general service;
(
11
)
explores the c
ontribution of industry, including supply chain developments, resource
efficiency/circular economy, and the cross
-
s
ystem implications of decarbonisation for industrial
systems; f
inally
(
12
)
takes a cross
-
sectoral perspective and explores
cross
-
cutting issu
es
like the
interactions of biomass energy, food and land, and carbon dioxide removal.
Four chapters then
review thematic
issues in implementation and governance of mitigation
. (
13
)
explores national and sub
-
national policies and institutions, bringing to
gether lessons of policies
examined in the sectoral chapters, as well as insights from service and demand
-
side perspectives
(
5
),
along with
governance approaches and capacity
-
building, and the role and relationships of sub
-
national
actors.
(
14
)
then consid
ers the roles and status of international cooperation, including
the UNFCCC
agreements and
international institutions, sectoral agreements and multiple forms of international
partnerships, and the ethics and governance challenges of Solar Radiation Modific
ation.
(
15
)
explores
investment and finance, including current trends, the inve
stment needs for deep decarbonis
ation, and
the complementary roles of public and private finance. This includes climate
-
related investment
opportunities and risks (e.g.
‘stranded assets’)
,
linkages between finance and investments in adaptation
and mitigation
; and the impact of COVID
-
19
.
A new chapter on innovation (
16
)
looks at technology
development
, accelerated deployment and global diffusion
as systemic issues that h
old potential for
transformative changes, and the challenges of manag
ing
such changes at multiple levels including the
role of international cooperation.
Finally,
(
17
)
considers
Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development, includ
ing
practical pathways for joint responses to climate change and sustainable development challenges. This
include
s
major regional perspectives, mitigation
-
adaptation interlinkages, and enabling conditions
including the roles of technology, finance and coop
eration for sustainable development.

What
is
climate
change
mitigation?
Climate
change
mitigation
refers
to
actions
or
activities
that
limit
emissions
of
GHGs
from
entering
the
atmosphere
and/or
reduce
their
levels
in
the
atmosphere.
Mitigation
includes
reducing
the
GHGs
emitted
from
energy
production
and
use
(
eg.
that
reduc
es
use
of
fossil
fuels)
and
land
use
,
and
methods
to
mitigate
warming
eg.
by
carbon
sink
s
which
remov
e
emissions
from
the
atmosphere
through
land
use
or
other
(including
artificial
)
mechanisms

The
ultimate
goal
of
mitigation
is
to
