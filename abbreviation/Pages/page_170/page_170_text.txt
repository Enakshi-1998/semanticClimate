Mitigation potential across sectors and systems
The total emission mitigation potential achievable by the year 2030, calculated
based on sectoral
assessments, is sufficient
to reduce globa
l greenhouse gas emissions to half of the current (2019)
level or less
(
high confidence
).
This potential
–
31 to 44 GtCO

-
eq
–
requires the implementation of a
wide range of mitigation options. Options
with mitigation costs lower than USD
20
tCO

-
1
make up
more than half of this potential and are available for all sectors
.
The market benefits of some options
exceed their cost

Cross
-
sectoral considerations in mitigation finance are critical for the effectiveness of mitigation
action as well as for balancing the often conflicting social, developmental, and environmental
policy goals at the sec
toral level
(medium confidence)
.
True resource mobilisation plans that properly
address mitigation costs and benefits at sectoral level cannot be developed in isolation of their cross
-
sectoral implications.
There is an urgent need for
multilateral financing institutions to align their
fra
meworks and delivery mechanisms including the use of blended financing to facilitate cross
-
sectoral
solutions as opposed to causing competition for resources among sectors
.
