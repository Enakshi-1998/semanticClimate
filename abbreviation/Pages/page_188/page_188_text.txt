Breakdown of average mitigation investment flows and investment needs until 2030
(USD bill
ion).
Given the multiple sources and lack of harmonised methodologies, the data
presented here
can be
considered only as indicative of the size and pattern of investment gaps. For full information of
sources see
chapter 15 Figure
15.4
.
Mitigation investment flows and investment needs
shown
by sector (energy efficiency,
transport, electricity, and agriculture, forestry and land use), by type of economy, and by region (see Annex II
Part I Section 1 for the c
lassification schemes for countr
ies and areas
).
Blue bars display data on mitigation
investment flows for four years: 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 by sector and by type of economy. For the regional
breakdown, the annual average mitigation investment flows for 2017
-
2019 are shown. The grey b
ars show the
minimum and maximum level of global annual mitigation investment needs in the assessed scenarios averaged
until 2030
. Multiplication factors show the ratio of global average yearly mitigation investment needs (averaged
until 2030) and current
yearly mitigation flows (averaged for 2017
-
2020). The lower multiplication factor refers
to the lower end of the range of investment needs. The upper multiplication factor refers to the upper range of
investment needs.
Data on mitigation investment flows d
oes not include technical assistance (i.e., policy and
national budget support or capacity building) and other non
-
technology deployment financing. Adaptation
pegged transactions are also excluded. Data on mitigation investment needs does not include needs
for
infrastructure investment or investment related to meeting the SDGs. {15.3, 15.4, 15.5, Table 15.2, Table 15.3,
Table 15.4}
The relatively slow implementation of commitments by countries and stakeholders in the financial
sector to scale up climate fi
nance reflects neither the urgent need for ambitious climate action,
nor the economic rationale for ambitious climate action
(high confidence)
.
Delayed climate
investments and financing
–
and limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreemen
t
–
will result in significant carbon lock
-
ins, stranded assets, and other additional costs. This will
particularly impact urban infrastructure and the energy and transport sectors
(high confidence)
. A
common understanding of debt sustainability and debt t
ransparency, including negative implications of
deferred climate investments on future GDP, and how stranded assets and resources may be
compensated, has not yet been developed
(medium confidence)
. {15.6}
There is a mismatch between capital availability in
the developed world and the future emissions
expected in developing countries
(
high confidence)
.
This emphasizes the need to recognize the
explicit and positive social value of global cross
-
border mitigation financing. A significant push for
international climate finance access for vulnerable and poor countries is particularly important given
these c
ountries’ high costs of financing, debt stress and the impacts of ongoing climate change
(high
confidence).
{15.2, 15.3.2.3, 15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.7}
Innovative financing approaches could help reduce the systemic under
-
pricing of climate risk in
markets and
foster demand
for
investment opportunities
aligned
with the
Paris
A
greement goals
.
Approaches include de
-
risking investments, robust ‘green’ labelling and disclosure schemes, in
addition to a regulatory focus on transparency and reforming international mo
netary system
financial sector regulations
(medium confidence)
.
Green bond markets and markets for sustainable
finance products have grown significantly since AR5 and the landscape continues to evolve.
Underpinning this evolution is investors’ preference f
or scalable and identifiable low
-
carbon investment
opportunities. These relative
ly
new labelled financial products will help by allowing a smooth
integration into existing asset allocation models.
(high confidence)
Green bond markets and markets for
sustai
nable finance products have also increased significantly since AR5, but c
hallenges nevertheless
remain
, in particular there are concerns about ‘greenwashing’ and the limited application of these
markets to developing countries
(
high
confidence

New business models (e.g.
