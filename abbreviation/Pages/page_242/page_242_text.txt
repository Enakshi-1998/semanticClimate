2030. Similarly
to the situation implied by the diversity of NDCs (both policies and pledge),
a fragmented policy landscape remains; mixed Covid recovery.
GS
Gradual
Until 2030, primarily current NDCs are implemented; after that a
strong, universal regime leads

to coordinated and rapid decarbonisation actions.
Neg
Net Negative
Successful international climate policy regime reduces emissions below ModAct
or GS to 2030,

but with a focus on the long

term temperature goal, negative emissions kick in at growing scales
thereafter, so that mitigation in all sectors also includes a growing and ultimately large reliance
on negative emissions, with large ‘net glob

overshoot

Renewables

LD
Low Demand
Successful international climate policy regime with immediate action on the demand
side; policies
and financial incentives favouring reduced demand that in turn leads to early emission reductions;
this reduces the decarbonisation effort on the supply side.
SP
Shifting
Successful international climate policy regime with a
focus on additional SDG policies aiming,
Pathways
for example, at poverty reduction and broader environmental protection.
Major transformations
shift development towards sustainability and reduced inequality, including deep GHG emissions
reduction.
