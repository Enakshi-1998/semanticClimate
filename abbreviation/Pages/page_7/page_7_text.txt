more difficult to quantify, can arise from the limited representation of land management in global models and
varying levels of accuracy and completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither
method is inherently preferable. Even when the same methodological approach is applied, the large uncertainty

including some that go back to 1850. In this report, GHG emissions are assessed from 1990, and CO

also from 1850. Reasons for this include data availability and robustness, scope of the assessed literature, and the
differing warming impacts of non-CO

B.2
Net anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors
globally. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas. Emissions reductions
in CO
2
from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP
and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity
levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings.

In 2019, approximately 34% [20 GtCO

from the energy supply sector, 24% [14 GtCO

If emissions from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors that use the
final energy, 90% of these indirect emissions are allocated to the industry and buildings sectors,
increasing their relative GHG emissions shares from 24% to 34%, and from 6% to 16%, respectively.
After reallocating emissions from electricity and heat production, the energy supply sector accounts for
12% of global net anthropogenic GHG emissions. (

Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the
