Technical Summary

AR6 WG III
Table TS.2
legend:
Key characteristics are reported for four groups of mitigation pathways: (i) immediate
action to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or
limited overshoot (C1 in Table TS.
3
; 97 scenarios), (ii) near team
action following the NDCs until 2030 and returning warming to below 1.5°C (50% chance) by 2100 with high
overshoot (subset of 42 scenarios following the NDCs until 2030 in C2), (iii) immedi
ate action to
likely
limit
warming to 2°C, (C3a in Table TS.
3
; 204 scenarios) and (iv) near term action following the NDCs until 2030
followed by post
-
2030 action to
likely
limit warming to 2°C (C3b in Table TS.
3
; 97 scenarios). The groups (i),
(iii), and
(iv) are depicted in
Figure TS.

. Reported are median and interquartile ranges (in brackets) for selected
global indicators. Numbers are rounded to the nearest five. Changes from 2019 are relative to modelled 2019
values. Emissions reductions are based on
harmoni
s
ed model emissions used for the climate assessment

here is a need to explore
how
accelerated mitigation
–
r
elative to NDCs and current policies
–
could close both e
mission gaps
, and
implementation gaps
.
There is
increasing understanding of the
technical content of accelerated mitigation pathways, differentiated by national circumstances, with
considerable
,
though uneven
,
literature at country
-
level (
medium evidence, high agreement
).
Transformative technological an
d institutional changes for the near
-
term include demand reductions
through efficiency and reduced activity, rapid decarbonisation of the electricity sector and low
-
carbon
electrification of buildings, industry and transport (
robust evidence, medium agreem
ent
). A focus on
energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its own
–
the land sector and food systems
deserve attention. The literature does not adequately include demand

side options and systems analysis,
and captures the impact from non

{4.2.5}
If obstacles
to accelerated mitigation
are rooted in underlying structural features of society, then
transforming such structures
can
support
emission reductions
{4.2.6}.
Countries and regions will
have different st
arting points for transition pathways. Some
critical differences between countries
include climate conditions resulting in different heating and cooling needs, endowments with different
energy resources, patterns of spatial development, and political and e
conomic conditions {4.2.5}.
The
way countries develop determines their capacity to accelerate mitigation and achieve other sustainable
development
objectives simultaneously (
medium
confidence)
{4.3.1, 4.3.2}. Yet meeting ambitious
mitigation and
development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change (
robust evidence,
medium agreement
). Though development pathways result from the actions of a wide range of actors,
it is possible to shift development pathways through policies and enhancing
enabling conditions (
limited
evidence, medium agreement
).
Shifting development pathways towards sustainability
offers ways to broaden the range of levers
and enablers that a society can use to accelerate mitigation
and increase
s
the
likelihood of making
p
rogress
simultaneously
on climate action and
other development goals (Box TS
.3
) {Cross

in Chapter
4, Figure 4.7, 4.3}.
There are practical options to shift development
pathways in ways that advance mitigation and other sustainable development
objectives, supporting
political feasibility, increase resources to meet multiple goals, and reduce emissions (
limited evidence,
high agreement
). Concrete examples
,
assessed in
chapter 4 of this report
,
include high employment and
low emissions structural
change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining housing
policies to deliver both housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social and spatial
patterns of development of the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustain
ed reductions in emissions
from deforestation
