highlighting its rapid growth from a low base. The table shows absolute emissions in 2019 as well as emissions
growth between 1990 and 2019, expressed as absolute change in CO

eq and as percentage change relative to
1990. Note that these changes ther

longer term trends.

The COVID
-
19 pandemic: Impact on emissions and opportunities for mitigation
The COVID
-
19 pandemic
triggered the deepest global economic contraction as well as CO
2
emission
reductions since the Second World War {2.2.2}. While emissions and most economies rebounded in
202
0
, some impacts of the pandemic could last well beyond this. Owing to the very recen
t nature of this
event, it remains unclear what the exact short and long
-
term impacts on global emissions drivers, trends
,
macroeconomics and finance will be.
S
tarting in the spring of 2020 a major break in global emissions trends was observed due to lock
down
policies implemented in response to the pandemic. Overall, global CO
2
-
FFI emissions are estimated to
have declined by 5.8%
(
5.1%
-
6.3%
)
in 2020, or about 2.2 (1.9

2.4) GtCO
2
in total. This exceeds any
previous global emissions decline since 1970 both i
n relative and absolute terms (Box TS.1 Figure 1).

but rebounded by the end of 2020. Impacts were differentiated by sector, with road
t
ransport and aviation particularly affected.
Different databases
estimate the total power sector CO
2
reduction from 2019 to 2020 at 3% (IEA
7
) and 4.5% (EDGAR
8
). Approaches that predict near real
-
time
estimates of the power sector reduction are more uncer
tain and estimates range more widely between
1.8%, 4.1% and 6.8%, the latter taking into account the over
-
proportional reduction of coal generation
due to low gas prices and merit order effects.
