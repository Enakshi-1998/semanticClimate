shock periods suggest that waves of innovation that are ready to emerge can be accelerated by crises,
which may prompt new behaviours, weaken incumbent systems, and
initiate rapid reform

A growing number of countries have achieved GHG emission reductions over periods longer than
10 years
–
a few at rates that are broadly consistent w

At least
24
countries have reduced CO

and GHG emissions for longer than 10 years.
Reduction rates in a few
countries have reached 4% in some years, in line with
global
rates observed in pathways that
likely
limit
warming to 2°C.
However, the total reduction in annual GHG emissions of these countries is small
