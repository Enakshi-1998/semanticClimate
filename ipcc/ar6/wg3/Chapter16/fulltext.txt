Innovation in climate mitigation technologies has seen enormous activity and significant 
progress  in  recent  years.  Innovation  has  also  led  to,  and  exacerbated,  trade-offs  in 
relation to sustainable development. (high confidence). Innovation, can leverage action to 
mitigate climate change by reinforcing other interventions. In conjunction with other enabling 
conditions  innovation  can  support  system  transitions  to  limit  warming  and  help  shift 
development pathways. The currently widespread implementation of solar photovoltaic (solar 
PV) and LEDs, for instance, could not have happened without technological innovation (high 
confidence).  Technological  innovation  can  also  bring  about  new  and  improved  ways  of 
delivering  services  that  are  essential  to  human  well-being.  At  the  same  time  as  delivering 
benefits,  innovation  can result in  trade-offs that undermine both  progress  on mitigation and 
progress 
include  negative 
externalities – for instance greater environmental pollution and social inequalities – rebound 
effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased 
dependency on foreign knowledge and providers (high confidence). Effective governance and 
policy has  the potential to  avoid  and minimise such misalignments  (medium evidence, high 
agreement). {16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5.1, 16.6}  

towards  other  sustainable  development  goals.  Trade-offs 

A systemic view of innovation to direct and organize the processes has grown over the 
last  decade.  This  systemic  view  of  innovation  takes  into  account  the  role  of  actors, 
institutions,  and  their  interactions  and  can  inform  how  innovation  systems  that  vary 
across technologies, sectors and countries, can be strengthened (high confidence). Where 
a  systemic  view  of  innovation  has  been  taken,  it  has  enabled  the  development  and 
implementation of indicators that are better able to provide insights in innovation processes. 
This,  in  turn, has enabled the analysis  and strengthening of innovation  systems.  Traditional 
quantitative  innovation  indicators  mainly  include  R&D  investments  and  patents.  Systemic 
indicators of innovation, however, go well beyond these approaches. They include structural 
innovation  system  elements  including  actors  and  networks,  as  well  as  indicators  for  how 
innovation systems function, such as access to finance, employment in relevant sectors, and 
lobbying activities. For example, in Latin America, monitoring systemic innovation indicators 
for  the  effectiveness  of  agroecological  mitigation  approaches  has  provided  insights  on  the 
appropriateness  and  social  alignment  of  new  technologies  and  practices.  Climate-energy-
economy  models,  including  integrated  assessment  models,  generally  employ  a  stylised  and 
necessarily  incomplete  view  of  innovation,  and  have  yet  to  incorporate  a  systemic 
representation of innovation systems {16.2, 16.2.4, 16.3, 16.3.4, 16.5, Table 16.7, Box 16.1, 
Box 16.5}.  

A  systemic  perspective  on  technological  change  can  provide  insights  to  policymakers 
supporting their selection of effective innovation policy instruments (high confidence). A 
combination of scaled-up innovation investments with demand-pull interventions can achieve 
faster technology unit cost reductions and more rapid scale-up than either approach in isolation 
(high confidence). These innovation policy instruments would nonetheless have to be tailored 
to  local  development  priorities,  to  the  specific  context  of  different  countries,  and  to  the 
technology being supported. The timing of interventions and any trade-offs with sustainable 
development also need to be addressed. Public R&D funding and support as well as innovation 
procurement have shown to be valuable for fostering innovation in small to medium cleantech

firms. Innovation outcomes of policy instruments not necessarily aimed at innovation, such as 
feed-in tariffs, auctions, emissions trading schemes, taxes and renewable portfolio standards, 
vary  from  negligible  to  positive  for  climate  change  mitigation.  Some  specific  designs  of 
environmental  taxation  can  also  result  in  negative  distributional  outcomes.  Most  of  the 
available literature and evidence on innovation systems come from industrialised countries and 
larger developing countries. However, there is a growing body of evidence from developing 
countries and small island developing states (SIDS) {16.4, 16.4.4.3, 16.4.4.4, 16.5, 16.7}. 

Experience  and  analyses  show  that  technological  change  is  inhibited  if  technological 
innovation system functions are not adequately fulfilled, this inhibition occurs more often 
in  developing  countries.  (high  confidence).  Examples  of  such  functions  are  knowledge 
development,  resource  mobilisation,  and  activities  that  shape  the  needs,  requirements  and 
expectations of actors within the innovation system (guidance of the search). Capabilities play 
a key role in these functions, the build-up of which can be enhanced by domestic measures, but 
also by international cooperation (high confidence). For instance, innovation cooperation on 
wind energy has contributed to the accelerated global spread of this technology. As another 
example, the policy guidance by the Indian government, which also promoted development of 
data, testing capabilities and knowledge within the private sector, has been a key determinant 
of the success of an energy-efficiency programme for air conditioners and refrigerators in India. 
{16.3, 16.5, 16.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter, Box 16.3} 

Consistent with innovation system approaches, the sharing of knowledge and experiences 
between developed and developing countries can contribute to addressing global climate 
and sustainable development goals. The effectiveness of such international cooperation 
arrangements, however, depends on the way they are developed and implemented (high 
confidence).  The  effectiveness  and  sustainable  development  benefits  of  technology  sharing 
under market conditions appears to be determined primarily by the complexity of technologies, 
local capabilities and the policy regime. This suggests that the development of planning and 
innovation capabilities remains necessary, especially in least-developed countries and SIDSs. 
International diffusion of low-emission technologies is also facilitated by knowledge spillovers 
from regions engaged in clean R&D (medium confidence).  

The evidence on the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in innovation is mixed. Some 
literature suggests that it is a barrier while and other sources suggests that it is an enabler 
to the diffusion of climate-related technologies (medium confidence). There is agreement 
that countries with well-developed institutional capacity may benefit from a strengthened IPR 
regime, but that countries with limited capabilities might face greater barriers to innovation as 
a consequence. This enhances the continued need for capacity building. Ideas to improve the 
alignment  of  the  global  IPR  regime  and  addressing  climate  change  include  specific 
arrangements for least-developed countries, case-by-case decision-making and patent-pooling 
institutions. {16.2.3.3, 16.5, Box 16.10}  

Although  some  initiatives  have  mobilised  investments  in  developing  countries,  gaps  in 
innovation  cooperation  remain,  including  in  the  Paris  Agreement  instruments.  These 
gaps  could  be  filled  by  enhancing  financial  support  for  international  technology 
cooperation,  by  strengthening  cooperative  approaches,  and  by  helping  build  suitable 
capacity  in  developing  countries  across  all  technological  innovation  system  functions 
(high confidence). The implementation of current arrangements of international cooperation

for technology development and transfer, as well as capacity building, are insufficient to meet 
climate objectives and contribute to sustainable development. For example, despite building a 
large  market  for  mitigation  technologies  in  developing  countries,  the  lack  of  a  systemic 
perspective in the implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism, operational since the 
mid-2000s, has only led to some technology transfer, especially to larger developing countries, 
but limited capacity building and minimal technology development (medium confidence). In 
the  current  climate  regime,  a  more  systemic  approach  to  innovation  cooperation  could  be 
introduced  by  linking  technology  institutions,  such  as  the  Technology  Mechanism,  and 
financial actors, such as the financial mechanism. {16.5.3}  

Countries  are  exposed  to  sustainable  development  challenges  in  parallel  with  the 
challenges  that  relate  to  climate  change.  Addressing  both  sets  of  challenges 
simultaneously  presents  multiple  and  recurrent  obstacles  that  systemic  approaches  to 
technological  change  could  help  resolve,  provided  they  are  well  managed  (high 
confidence). Obstacles include both entrenched power relations dominated by vested interests 
that control and benefit from existing technologies, and governance structures that continue to 
reproduce unsustainable patterns of production and consumption (medium confidence). Studies 
also highlight the potential of cultural factors to strongly influence the pace and direction of 
technological  change.  Sustainable  solutions  require  adoption  and  mainstreaming  of  locally 
novel  technologies  that  can  meet  local  needs,  and  simultaneously  address  the  Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). Acknowledging the systemic nature of technological innovation, 
which  involve  many  levels  of  actors,  stages  of  innovation  and  scales,  can  lead  to  new 
opportunities to shift development pathways towards sustainability. {16.4, 16.5, 16.6} 

An  area  where  sustainable  development,  climate  change  mitigation  and  technological 
change  interact  is  digitalisation.    Digital  technologies  can  promote  large  increases  in 
energy efficiency through coordination and an economic shift to services, but they can 
also greatly increase energy demand because of the energy used in digital devices. System-
level rebound effects may also occur. (high confidence) Digital devices, including servers, 
increase  pressure  on  the  environment  due  to  the  demand  for  rare  metals  and  end-of-life 
disposal. The absence of adequate governance in many countries can lead to harsh working 
conditions  and  unregulated  disposal  of  electronic  waste.  Digitalization  also  affects  firms' 
competitiveness, the demand for skills, and the distribution of, and access to, resources. The 
existing  digital  divide,  especially  in  developing  countries,  and  the  lack  of  appropriate 
governance  of  the  digital  revolution  can  hamper  the  role  that  digitalization  could  play  in 
supporting  the achievement  of stringent mitigation targets.  At present,  the understanding  of 
both  the  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  digitalization  on  energy  use,  carbon  emissions  and 
potential mitigation, is limited (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter, 
16.2}  

Strategies  for  climate  change  mitigation  can  be  most  effective  in  accelerating 
transformative change when actions taken to strengthen one set of enabling conditions 
also  reinforce  and  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  other  enabling  conditions  (medium 
confidence). Applying transition or system dynamics to decisions can help policymakers take 
advantage  of  such  high-leverage  intervention  points,  address  the  specific  characteristics  of 
technological  stages,  and  respond  to  societal  dynamics.  Inspiration  can  be  drawn  from  the 
global unit cost reductions of solar PV, which were accelerated by a combination of factors

interacting in a mutually reinforcing way across a limited group of countries (high confidence). 
{Box 16.2, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in chapter 14}  

Better and more comprehensive data on innovation indicators can provide timely insights 
for policymakers and policy design locally, nationally and internationally, especially for 
developing countries, where such insights are missing more often. Data needed include on 
those that can show the strength of technological, sectoral and national innovation systems. It 
is also necessary to validate current results and generate insights from theoretical frameworks 
and empirical studies for developing countries contexts. Innovation studies on adaptation and 
mitigation  other  than  energy  and  ex-post  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  various 
innovation-related  policies  and  interventions,  including  R&D,  would  also  provide  benefits. 
Furthermore,  methodological  developments  to  improve  the  ability  of  Integrated  Assessment 
Models (IAMs) to capture energy innovation system dynamics, and the relevant institutions and 
policies  (including  design  and  implementation),  would  allow  for  more  realistic  assessment.

16.1 Introduction  

Technological  change  and  innovation  are  considered  key  drivers  of  economic  growth  and  social 
progress (Brandão Santana et al. 2015; Heeks and Stanforth 2015). The economic beneﬁt derived from 
increased production and consumption of goods as well as services create higher demands for improved 
technologies  (Gossart  2015).  Since  the  Industrial  Revolution,  however,  and  notwithstanding  the 
benefits, this production and consumption trend and the technological changes associated to it have also 
come at the cost of long-term damage to the life support systems of our planet (Alarcón and Vos 2015; 
Steffen et al. 2015). The significance of the such impacts depends on the technology, but also on the 
intrinsic characteristics of the country or region analysed (Brandão Santana et al. 2015).  

Other  chapters  in  this  volume  have  discussed  technological  change  in  various  ways,  including  as  a 
framing  issue  (chapter  1),  in  the  context  of  specific  sectors  (chapters  6-11),  for  specific  purposes 
(chapter 12) and as a matter of policy, international cooperation and finance (chapters 13-15). Chapter 
2 discusses past trends in technological change and chapters 3 and 4 discuss it in the context of future 
modelling. In general, implicitly or explicitly, technological change is assigned an important role in 
climate change mitigation and achieving sustainable development (Thacker et al. 2019), also in past 
IPCC reports (IPCC 2014, 2018a). Chapter 16 describes how a well-established innovation system at a 
national level, guided by well-designed policies, can contribute to achieve mitigation and adaptation 
targets  along  with  broader  sustainable  development  goals  avoiding,  in  the  process,  undesired 
consequences of technological changes. 

The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, including emissions of GHG, are greatly 
influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes (Jaffe et al. 2000). Technological changes 
usually designed and used to increase productivity and reduce the use of natural resources can lead to 
increasing production and consumption of goods and services through different rebound effects that 
diminish the potential benefits of reducing the pressure on the environment (Grübler 1998; Kemp and 
Soete 1990; Gossart 2015; Sorrell 2007; Barker et al. 2009). 

Those environmental impacts depend not only on which technologies are used, but also on how they 
are used (Grübler et al. 1999a). Technological change is not exogenous to social and economic systems; 
technologies are not conceived, selected, and applied autonomously (Grubler et al. 2018). Underlying 
driving  forces  of  the  problem,  such  as  more  resource  intensive  lifestyles  and  larger  populations 
(Hertwich and Peters 2009; UNEP 2014), remain largely unchallenged. Comprehensive knowledge of 
the direct and indirect effects of technological changes on physical and social systems could improve 
decision-making, also in those cases where technological change mitigates environmental impacts.  

A sustainable global future for people and nature requires rapid and transformative societal change by 
integrating  technical,  governance  (including  participation),  financial  and  societal  aspects  of  the 
solutions to be implemented (Pörtner et al. 2021; Sachs et al. 2019). A growing body of interdisciplinary 
research  from  around  the  world  can  inform  implementation  of  adaptive  solutions  that  address  the 
benefits and drawbacks of linkages in social-ecological complexity, including externalities and rebound 
effects from innovation and technological transformation (Pörtner et al. 2021; Balvanera et al. 2017).  

Technological  change  and transitional  knowledge  can  reinforce  each  other.  The  value  of  traditional 
wisdom and its technological practices provide examples of sustainable and adaptive systems that could 
potentially  adapt  to  and  mitigate  climate  change  (Singh  et  al.  2020;  Kuoljok  2019).  Peasants  and 
traditional  farmers  have  been  able  to  respond  well  to  climate  changes  through  their  wisdom  and 
traditional  practices  (Nicholls  and  Alteri 2013).  The  integration  of  the traditional  wisdom  with new 
technologies can offer new and effective solutions (Galloway McLean 2010).

Achieving climate change mitigation and other sustainable development goals thus also requires rapid 
diffusion  of  knowledge  and  technological  innovations.  However,  these  are  hampered  by  various 
barriers, some of which are illustrated in Table 16.1 (Markard et al. 2020).

The literature on how, in a systemic way, the barriers to sustainability transition can be overcome in 
various circumstances has been growing rapidly over the past decades. A central element is that national 
systems of innovation can help achieving both climate change and sustainable development goals, by 
integrating new ideas, devices, resources, new and traditional knowledge and technological changes for 
more effective and adaptive solutions (Lundvall 1992). At the organizational level, innovation is seen 
as a process that can bring value  by means of creating more effective products, services, processes, 
technologies, policies and business models that are applicable to commercial, business, financial and 
even societal or political organizations (Brooks 1980; Arthur 2009).  

The literature refers to the terms “technology push,” “market pull,” “regulatory push-pull,” and “firm 
specific factors” as drivers for innovation, mostly to inform policymakers (Zubeltzu-Jaka et al. 2018). 
There has also been growing interest in social drivers, motivated by the recognition of social issues, 
such  as  unemployment  and  public  health,  linked  to  the  deployment  of  innovative  low-carbon 
technologies  (Altantsetseg  et  al.  2020).  Policy  and  social  factors  and  the  diverse  trajectories  of 
innovation are influenced by regional and national conditions (Tariq et al. 2017), and such local needs 
and  purposes  need  to  be  considered  in  crafting  international  policies  aimed  at  fostering  the  global 
transition  towards  increased  sustainability  (Caravella  and  Crespi  2020).  From  this  standpoint,  a 
multidimensional,  multi-actor  systemic  innovation  approach  would  be  needed  to  enhance  global 
innovation diffusion (de Jesus and Mendonça 2018), especially if this is to lead to overall sustainability 
improvements rather than resulting in new sustainability challenges.

Policies  to  mitigate  climate  change  do  not  always  take  into  account  the  effects  of  mitigation 
technologies on other environmental and social challenges (Arvesen et al. 2011). Policies also often 
disregard  the  strong  linkages  between  technological  innovation  and  social  innovation;  the  latter 
understood as the use of soft technologies that brings about transformation through establishing new 
institutions,  new  practices,  and  new  models  to  create  a  positive  societal  impact  characterized  by 
collaboration that crosses traditional roles and boundaries, between citizens, civil society, the state, and 
the  private  sector  (Reynolds  et  al.  2017).  Market  forces  do  not  provide  sufficient  incentives  for 
investment in development or diffusion of technologies, leaving a role for public policy to create the 
conditions to assure a systemic innovation approach (Popp 2010; Popp and Newell 2012). Moreover, 
public action is more than just addressing market failure, it is an unalienable element of an innovation 
system (Mazzucato 2013).  

Coupling technological innovation with sustainable development and the SDGs would need to address 
overall social, environmental, and economic consequences, given that public policy is intertwined with 
innovation, technological changes and other factors in a complex manner. Chapter 16 is organized in 
the following manner to provide an overview of innovation and technology development and transfer 
for climate change and sustainable development. 

Section  16.2  discusses  drivers  of  innovation  process,  including  macro  factors  that  can  redirect 
technological change towards low-carbon options. Representations of these drivers in mathematical and 
statistical  models  allow  for  explaining  the  past  and  constructing  projections  of  future  technological 
change. They also integrate the analysis of drivers and consequences of technological change within 
economic-energy-economy  (or  integrated  assessment)  models  (see  Chapter  3).  The  section  also 
describes the different phases of innovation and metrics, such as the widely used but also criticized 
technology readiness levels (TRLs).  

Section 16.3 discusses innovation as a systemic process based on recent literature. While the innovation 
process is often stylized as a linear process, innovation is now predominantly seen as a systemic process 
in that it is a result of actions by, and interactions among, a large set of actors, whose activities are 
shaped  by,  and  shape,  the  context  in  which  they  operate  and  the  user  group  with  which  they  are 
engaging.  

Section  16.4  presents  innovation  and  technology  policy,  including  technology  push  (e.g.,  publicly 
funded  R&D)  and  demand-pull  (e.g.,  governmental  procurement  programmes)  instruments  that 
addresses  potential  market  failures  related  to  innovation  and  technology  diffusion.  The  section  also 
assesses  the  cost-effectiveness  and  other  policy  assessment  criteria  introduced  in  Chapter  13  of 
innovation policies.  

In section 16.5, the chapter assesses the role of international cooperation in technology development 
and transfer, in particular the mechanisms established under the UNFCCC, but also other international 
initiatives for technology cooperation. The discussion on international cooperation includes information 
exchange,  research,  development  and  demonstration  cooperation,  access  to  financial  instruments, 
intellectual property rights, as well as promotion of domestic capacities and capacity building.  

Section 16.6 describes the role of technology in sustainable development, including unintended effects 
of technological changes, and synthesizes the chapter. Finally, section 16.7 discusses gaps in knowledge 
emerging from this chapter.

16.2 Elements, drivers and modelling of technology innovation  

Models of the innovation process, its drivers and incentives provide a tool for technology assessment, 
constructing  projections  of  technological  change  and  identifying  which  macro  conditions  facilitate 
development of low-carbon technologies. The distinction between stages of innovation process allows 
to assess technology readiness (Section 16.2.1). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of main elements 
underpinning innovation - R&D, learning-by-doing, spillovers allow for explanation of past and project 
future technological change (Section 16.2.2). In addition, general purpose technologies can play a role 
in climate change mitigation.  

In the context of mitigation pathways, the feasibility of any emission reduction targets depends on the 
ability to promote innovation in low- and zero-carbon technologies, as opposed to any other technology. 
For this reason, the section reviews the literature of the levers influencing the direction of technological 
change in favour of low- and zero-carbon technologies (Section 16.2.3). Moreover, representation of 
drivers in mathematical and statistical models from section 16.2.2 allows integrating its analysis with 
economic and climate effects within IAMs, hence permitting more precise modelling of decarbonisation 
pathways (Section 16.2.4).   

In  addition  to  technological  innovation,  other  innovation  approaches  are  relevant  in  the  context  of 
climate mitigation and more broadly sustainable development (Section 16.6). Frugal innovations, i.e. 
“good  enough”  innovations  that  fulfil  the  needs  of  non-affluent  consumers  mostly  in  developing 
countries  (Hossain  2018), are  characterized  by  low  costs, concentration  on core  functionalities, and 
optimised  performance  level  (Weyrauch  and  Herstatt  2016)  and  are  hence  often  associated  with 
(ecological and social) sustainability (Albert 2019). Grassroots innovations are products, services and 
processes  developed  to  address  specific  local  challenges  and  opportunities,  and  which  can  generate 
novel,  bottom-up  solutions  responding  to  local  situations,  interests  and  values.  (Dana  et  al.  2021; 
Pellicer-Sifres et al. 2018).  

16.2.1  Stages of the innovation process 

The innovation cycle is commonly thought of as having three distinct innovation phases on the path 
between basic research and commercial application: Research and Development (R&D), demonstration, 
and deployment and diffusion (IPCC 2007). Each of these phases differs with respect to the kind of 
activity carried out, the type of actors involved and their role, financing needs and the associated risks 
and uncertainties. All phases involve a process of trial and error, and failure is common; the share of 
innovation that successfully reaches the deployment phase is small. The path occurring between basic 
research to commercialization is not linear (see also Section 16.3); it often requires a long time and is 
characterized  by  significant  bottlenecks  and  roadblocks.  Furthermore,  technologies  may  regress 
backwards in the innovation cycle, rather than move forward (Skea et al. 2019). Successfully passing 
from  each  stage  to  the  next  one  in  the  innovation  cycle  requires  overcoming  “valleys  of  deaths” 
(Auerswald and Branscomb 2003; UNFCCC 2017), most notably the demonstration phase (Frank et al. 
1996; Weyant 2011; Nemet et al. 2018). Over time, new and improved technologies are discovered; 
this often makes the dominant technology obsolete, but this is not discussed here further.  

Table 16.2 summarizes the different innovation stages and main funding actors, and maps phases into 
the technology readiness levels (TRLs) discussed in Section 16.2.1.4.

16.2.1.1  Research and Development 

This phase of the innovation process focuses on generating knowledge or solving particular problems 
by creating a combination of artefacts that is intended to perform a particular function, or to achieve a 
specific goal. R&D activities comprise basic research, applied research and technology development. 
Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of 
the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or 
use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge, 
primarily  directed  towards  a  specific,  practical  aim  or  objective  (OECD  2015a).  Importantly,  R&D 
activities can be incremental, i.e. focused on addressing a specific need by marginally improving an 
already existing technology, or radical, representing a paradigm shift, promoted by new opportunities 
arising with the accumulation of new knowledge (Mendonça et al. 2018). Technology development, 
often leading to prototyping, consists of generating a working model of the technology that is usable in 
the real world, proving the usability and customer desirability of the technology and giving an idea of 
its design, features and functioning (OECD 2015a). These early stages of technological innovation are

referred to as “formative phase”, during which the conditions are shaped for a technology to emerge 
and become established in the market (Wilson and Grubler 2013) and the constitutive elements of the 
innovation system emerging around a particular technology are set up (see Section 16.3)(Bento et al. 
2018; Bento and Wilson 2016). 

The outcomes of R&D are uncertain: the amount of knowledge that will result from any given research 
project  or  investment  is  unknown  ex  ante  (Rosenberg  1998).  This  risk  to  funders  (Goldstein  and 
Kearney 2020) translates into underinvestment in R&D due to low appropriability (Sagar and Majumdar 
2014; Weyant 2011). In the case of climate mitigation technologies, low innovation incentives for the 
private sector  also result from a negative environmental externality (Jaffe et al. 2005). Furthermore, in 
absence  of  stringent  climate  policies  and  targets,  incumbent  fossil-based  energy  technologies  are 
characterized  by  lower  financing  risk,  are  heavily  subsidized  (Kotchen  2021;  Davis  2014)  and 
depreciate slowly (see Section 16.2.3) (Nanda et al. 2016; Semieniuk et al. 2021; Arrow 1962a). In this 
context  public  research  funding  therefore  plays  a  key  role  in  supporting  high-risk  R&D  both  in 
developed and developing economies: it can provide patient and steady funding not tied to short-term 
investment returns (see Section 16.4) (Anadon et al. 2014; Mazzucato 2015a; Howell 2017; Zhang et 
al. 2019; Anadón et al. 2017; Chan and Diaz Anadon 2016; Kammen and Nemet 2007). Public policies 
also play a role increasing private incentives in energy research and development funding (Nemet 2013). 
R&D  statistics  are an important  indicator of  innovation  and  are  collected following the  rules  of the 
Frascati Manual (OECD 2015b) (Section 16.3.3, Box 16.3, Table 16.7). 

16.2.1.2  Demonstration 

Demonstration is carried out through pilot projects or large-scale testing in the real world. Successfully 
demonstrating  a  technology  shows  its  utility and that  it is able to achieve its  intended  purpose and, 
consequently, that the risk of failure is reduced (i.e. that it has market potential) (Hellsmark et al. 2016). 
Demonstration  project  are  an  important  step  to  promote  the  deployment  of  low-carbon  energy  and 
industrial technologies in the context of the transition. government funding often plays a large role in 
energy  technology  demonstration  projects  because  scaling  up  hardware  energy  technologies  is  
expensive and risky (Brown and Hendry 2009; Hellsmark et al. 2016). Governments’ engagement in 
low-carbon technology demonstration also signals support for business willing to take the investment 
risk (Mazzucato 2016). Venture capital, traditionally not tailored for energy investment, can play an 
increasingly important role also thanks to the incentives (e.g. through de-risking) provided by public 
funding and policies (Gaddy et al. 2017; IEA 2017a). 

16.2.1.3  Deployment and diffusion 

Deployment  entails  producing  a  technology  at  large  scale  and  scaling  up  its  adoption  use  across 
individual  firms  or  households  in  a  given  market,  and  across  different  markets  (Jaffe  2015).  In  the 
context  of  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  technologies,  the  purposeful  diffusion  to 
developing  countries,  is  referred  to  as  “technology  transfer”.  Most  recently,  the  term  "  innovation 
cooperation" has been proposed to indicate that technologies needs to be co-developed and adapted to 
local  contexts  (Pandey  et  al.  2021).  Innovation  cooperation  is  an  important  component  of  stringent 
mitigation strategies as well as international agreements (see Section 16.5).  

Diffusion  is  often  sluggish  due  to  lock-in  of  dominant  technologies  (Liebowitz  and  Margolis  1995; 
Unruh  2000;  Ivanova  et  al.  2018),  as  well  as  the  time  needed  to  diffuse  information  about  the 
technologies,  heterogeneity  among  adopters,  the  incentive  to  wait  until  costs  fall  even  further,  the 
presence of behavioural and institutional barriers and the uncertainty surrounding mitigation policies 
and long-term commitments to climate targets (Corey 2014; Haelg et al. 2018; Gillingham and Sweeney 
2012;  Jaffe  2015).  In  addition,  novel  technology  has  been  hindered  by  the  actions  of  powerful 
incumbents who accrue economic and political advantages over time, as in the case of renewable 
energy generation (Unruh 2002; Supran and Oreskes 2017; Hoppmann et al. 2019).

Technologies  have  been  shown  to  penetrate  the  market  with  a  gradual  non-linear  process  in  a 
characteristic  logistic  (S-shaped)  curve  (Rogers  2003;  Grübler  1996).  The  time  needed  to  reach 
widespread adoption varies greatly across technologies relevant for adaptation and mitigation (Gross et 
al. 2018); in the case of energy technologies, the time needed for technologies to get from a 10 to 90% 
market share of saturation ranges between 5 to over 70 (Wilson 2012). Investment in commercialization 
of low-emission technology is largely provided by private financiers; however, governments play a key 
role in ensuring incentives through supportive policies, including R&D expenditures providing signals 
to  private  investors  (Haelg  et  al.  2018),  pricing  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  public  procurement, 
technology standards, information diffusion and the regulation for end-life cycle treatment of products 
(Cross and Murray 2018) (see Section 16.4).  

16.2.1.4  Technology Readiness Levels  

Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are a categorization that enables consistent, uniform discussions 
of technical maturity across different types of technology. They were developed by NASA in the 1970s 
(Mankins 2009, 1995) and originally used to describe the readiness of components forming part of a 
technological system. Over time, more classifications of TRLs have been introduced, notably the one 
used by the EU. Most recently, the IEA extended previous classifications to include the later stages of 
the innovation process (IEA 2020b) and applied  it to compare the market readiness of clean energy 
technologies  and their components  (OECD  2015a;  IEA  2020b).  TRLs are  currently  widely  used  by 
engineers,  business  people,  research  funders  and  investors,  often  to  assess  the  readiness  of  whole 
technologies rather than single components. To determine a TRL for a given technology, a Technology 
Readiness Assessment (TRA) is carried out to examine programme concepts, technology requirements, 
and demonstrated technology capabilities. In the most recent version of the IEA (IEA 2020b), TRLs 
range from 1 to 11, with 11 indicating the most mature (see Table 16.2). 

The purpose of TRLs is to support decision making. They are applied to avoid the premature application 
of technologies, which would lead to increased costs and project schedule extension (US Department 
of Energy 2011). They are used for risk management, and can also be used to make decisions regarding 
technology funding and to support the management of the R&D process within a given organization or 
country (De Rose et al. 2017).  

In practice, the usefulness of TRLs is limited by several factors. These include limited applicability in 
complex  technologies  or  systems,    the  fact  that  they  do  not  define  obsolescence,  nor  account  for 
manufacturability,  commercialization  or  the  readiness  of  organizations  to  implement  innovations 
(European Association of Research Technology Organisations 2014) and do not consider any type of 
technology-system mismatch  or the relevance  of  the products’  operation environment to the  system 
under  consideration  (Mankins  2009).  Many  of  these  limitations  can  be  eased  by  using  TRLs  in 
combination with other indicators such as System Readiness Levels and other economic indicators on, 
for example, investments and returns (IEA 2020b). 

16.2.2  Sources of technological change  

The speed of technological change could be explained with the key drivers of innovations process: R&D 
effort, learning-by-doing and spillover effects. In addition, new innovations are sometimes enabled by 
the development of general purpose technologies, such as digitalization. 

16.2.2.1  Learning-by-doing and research and development 
Learning by doing and R&D effort are two factors commonly used by the literature to explain past and 
project future speed of technological change (Klaassen et al. 2005; Mayer et al. 2012; Bettencourt et al. 
2013).  Learning-by-doing  is  the interaction of  workers  with  new  machines  or  processes that  allows 
them to use them more efficiently (Arrow 1962b). R&D effort is dedicated to looking for new solutions

(e.g. blueprints) that could increase the efficiency of existing production methods or result in entirely 
new methods, products or services (see section 16.2.1.1). 

Learning-by-doing  and  research  and  development  are  interdependent.  Young  (1993)  postulates  that 
learning-by-doing cannot continue forever without R&D because it is bounded by an upper physical 
productivity limit of an existing technology. Research and development can shift this limit because it 
allows replacing the existing technology with a new one. On other hand, incentives to invest in R&D 
depend on future cost of manufacturing, which in turn depend on the scale of learning-by-doing. The 
empirical evidence for virtuous circle between costs reduction, market growth and R&D were found in 
the  case  of  PV  market  ((Watanabe  et  al.  2000);  see  also  Box  16.4),  but  could  also  lead  to  path 
dependency and lock-in (Erickson et al. 2015). Section 16.4.4 and Chapter 13 Section 13.7.3.1. discuss 
how  simultaneous  use  of  technology  push  and  pull  policies  could  amplify  effects  of  research  and 
learning.  

The  benefits  of  R&D  and  learning-by-doing  are  larger  at  the  economy  level  than  at  the  firms  level 
(Romer 1990; Arrow 1962b). As a result, the market, left to its own, tends to generate less investment 
than socially optimal. For instance, if the cost of a technology is too high before a large amount of 
learning-by-doing has occurred, there is a risk that it will not be adopted by the market even if it is 
economically advantageous for the society. Indeed, initially new technologies are often expensive and 
cannot compete with the incumbent technologies (Cowan 1990). Large numbers of adopters could lower 
this cost via learning-by-doing to a level sufficient to beat the incumbent technology (Gruebler et al. 
2012). However, firms could hesitate to be the first adopter and bear the high cost (Isoard and Soria 
2001). If this disadvantage overwhelms the advantages of being a first mover1  and if adopters are not 
able to coordinate, it will lead to situation of a lock-in (Gruebler et al. 2012). 

The  failure  of  markets  to  deliver  the  size  of  R&D  investment  and  learning-by-doing  that  would  be 
socially optimal is one of the justifications of government intervention. Policies to address these market 
failures can be categorized as technology push and demand pull policies. The role of these policies is 
explained in Table 16.3. Section 16.4 discusses individual policy instruments in greater detail.

The  size  of  learning-by-doing  effect  is  quantified  in  literature  using  learning  rates  i.e.  estimates  of 
negative  correlation  between  costs  and  size  of  deployment  of  technologies.  The  results  from  this 
literature include estimates for energy technologies (McDonald and Schrattenholzer 2001), electricity 
generation technologies (Rubin et al. 2015; Samadi 2018), for storage (Schmidt 2017), for end-of-pipe 
control (Kang et al. 2020) and for energy demand and energy supply technologies (Weiss et al. 2010). 
Meta-analyses find learning rates vary across technologies, within technologies and over time (Wei et 
al. 2017; Nemet 2009a; Rubin et al. 2015). Moreover, different components of one technology have 
different learning rates (Elshurafa et al. 2018). Central tendencies are around 20% cost reduction for 
each doubling of deployment (McDonald and Schrattenholzer 2001).  

Studies of correlation between cumulative deployment of technologies and costs are not sufficiently 
precise to disentangle the causal effect of increase in deployment from the causal effects of research 
and development and other factors (Nemet 2006). Numerous subsequent studies attempted to, amongst 
others, separate the effect of learning-by-doing and research and development (Klaassen et al. 2005; 
Mayer et al. 2012; Bettencourt et al. 2013), economies of scale (Arce 2014), and knowledge spillovers 
(Nemet 2012). Once those other factors are accounted for, some empirical studies find that the role of 
learning-by-doing  in  driving  down  the  costs  becomes  minor  (Kavlak  et  al.  2018;  Nemet  2006).  In 
addition the relation could reflect reverse causality: increase in deployment could be an effect (and not 
a cause) of a drop in price (Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2015; Nordhaus 2014). Nevertheless, in some 
applications, learning curves can be a useful proxy and heuristic (Nagy et al. 2013). 

The negative relation between costs and experience is a reason to invest in a narrow set of technologies; 
the  uncertainty  regarding  the  parameters  of  this  relation  is  the  reason  to  invest  in  wider  ranges  of 
technologies (Way et al. 2019; Fleming and Sorenson 2001). Concentrating investment in narrow sets 
of technologies (specialization) enables fast accumulation of experience for these technologies and large 
cost  reductions.  However,  when  the  potency  of  technology  is  uncertain,  one  does  not  know  which 
technology is truly optimal in the long-run. The narrower the set the higher the risk that the optimal 
technology will not be supported, and hence will not benefit from learning-by-doing. Widening the set 
of supported technologies would reduce this risk (Way et al. 2019). Uncertainty is present because noise 
in historical data hides the true value of learning rates as well as because of unanticipated future shocks 
to technology costs (Lafond et al. 2018). Ignoring uncertainty in integrated assessment models implies 
that these model results are biased towards supporting narrow set of technologies neglecting the benefits 
of decreasing risk trough diversification (Sawulski and Witajewski-Baltvilks 2020). 

16.2.2.2  Knowledge spillovers  
Knowledge spillovers drive continuous technological change (Rivera-Batiz and Romer 1991; Romer 
1990) and are for that reason relevant to climate technologies as well as incumbent, carbon-intensive 
technologies. Knowledge embedded in innovations by one innovator give an opportunity for others to 
create  new  innovations  and  increase  the  knowledge  stock  even  further.  The  constant  growth  of 
knowledge stock through spillovers translates into constant growth of productivity and cost reduction.

By  allowing  for  experimenting  with  existing  knowledge  and  combining  different  technologies, 
knowledge  spillovers  can  result  in  the  emergence  of  novel  technological  solutions,  which  has  been 
referred to as recombinant innovation (Weitzman 1998; Olsson and Frey 2002; Tsur and Zemel 2007; 
Arthur 2009; Fleming and Sorenson 2001). Recombinant innovations speed up technological change 
by combining different technological solutions, and make things happen that would be impossible with 
only incremental innovations (Safarzyńska and van den Bergh 2010; van den Bergh 2008; Frenken et 
al. 2012). It has been shown that 77%  of all patents granted between 1790 and 2010 in the US are coded 
by a combination of at least two technology codes (Youn et al. 2015). Spillovers related to energy and 
low-carbon  technologies  has  been  documented  by  a  number  of  empirical  studies  (high  confidence) 
(Popp 2002; Aghion et al. 2013; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017; Verdolini and Galeotti 2011; Conti 
et al. 2018). The presence of spillovers can have both positive and negative impacts on climate change 
mitigation (high confidence).  

The spillover effect associated with innovation in carbon-intensive technologies may lead to lock-in of 
fossil-fuel technologies. Continuous technological change of carbon-intensive industry raises the bar 
for clean technologies: a larger drop in clean technologies’ cost is necessary to become competitive 
(Acemoglu et al. 2012; Aghion et al. 2013). The implication is that delaying climate policy increases 
the cost of that policy (Aghion 2019). 

On the other hand, the spillover effect associated with innovation in low-emission technologies increase 
the potency of climate policy (Aghion 2019). For instance, a policy that encourages clean innovation 
leads to accumulation of knowledge in clean industry which, through spillover effect encourages further 
innovation in clean industries. Once the stock of knowledge is sufficiently large, the value of clean 
industries will be so high, that technology firms will invest there even without policy incentives. Once 
this point is reached, the policy intervention can be discontinued (Acemoglu et al. 2012). 

In addition, the presence of spillovers implies that a unilateral effort to reduce emissions in one region 
could reduce emissions in other regions (medium confidence) (Gerlagh and Kuik 2014; Golombek and 
Hoel 2004). For instance, in the presence of spillovers, a carbon tax that incentivises clean technological 
change increases the competitiveness of clean technologies not only locally, but also abroad. The size 
of this effect depends on the size of spillovers. If they are sufficiently strong, the reduction of emissions 
abroad due to clean technological change could be larger than the increase of emissions due to carbon 
leakage  (Gerlagh  and  Kuik  2014).  Different  types  of  carbon  leakage  are  discussed  in  Chapter  13, 
Section 13.7.1 and other consequences of spillovers for the design of policy are discussed in Chapter 
13, Section 13.7.3. 

16.2.2.3  General purpose technologies and digitalization  
General  purpose  technologies  (GPTs)    provide  solutions  that  could  be  applied  across  sectors  and 
industries (Goldfarb 2011) by creating technological platforms for a growing number of interrelated 
innovations.  Examples  of  GPTs  relevant  to  climate  change  mitigation  are  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell 
technology, which may find applications in transport, industry and distributed generation (Hanley et al. 
2018), and nanotechnology which played a significant role in advancement of all the different types of 
renewable  energy  options  (Hussein  2015).  Assessing  the  environmental,  social  and  economic 
implications of such technologies, including increased emissions through energy use, is challenging 
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.3.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 11 below).  

Several GPTs relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation emerged as a result digitalization, namely 
the  adoption  or  increase  in  use  of  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs)  by  citizens,  
organizations, industries or countries and the associated restructuring of several domains of social life 
and of the economy around digital technologies and infrastructures (IEA 2017b; Brennen and Kreiss 
2016).  The  digital  revolution  is  underpinned  by  innovation  in  key  technologies,  e.g.  ubiquitous 
connected consumer devices such as mobile phones (Grubler et al. 2018), rapid expansions of global 
internet  infrastructure  and  access  (World  Bank  2014),  and  steep  cost  reductions  and  performance

improvements in computing devices, sensors, and digital communication technologies  (Verma et al. 
2020). The increasing the pace at which the physical and digital worlds are converging increase the 
relevance of disruptive digitalization in the context of climate mitigation and sustainability challenges  
(European Commission 2020) (see Cross-chapter Box 11 in this chapter and Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1). 

Digital  technologies  require  energy,  but  increase  efficiency,  potentially offering  technology-specific 
GHG emission savings; they also have larger system wide impacts (Kaack et al. 2021). In industrial 
sectors,  robotization, smart manufacturing (SM), internet of things  (IoT),  artificial intelligence (AI), 
and additive manufacturing (AM or 3D printing), have the potential to reduce  material demand and 
promote  energy  management  (Chapter  11,  Section  11.3.4.2).  Smart  mobility  is  changing  transport 
demand  and efficiency (Chapter  10,  Section 10.2.3).  Smart  devices in  buildings,  the deployment  of 
smart  grids  and  the  provision  of  renewable  energy  increase  the  role  of  demand-side  management 
(Serrenho and Bertoldi 2019) (Chapter 9, Sections 9.4 and 9.5), and support the shift away from asset 
redundancy (Chapter 6, Section 6.4.3). Digital solutions are equally important on the supply side, for 
example by accelerating innovation with simulations and deep learning (Rolnick et al. 2021) or realizing 
flexible  and  decentralized  opportunities  through  energy-as-a-service  concepts  and  particularly  with 
Pay-As-You-Go (Chapter 15, Box 15.8, Table 1).  

Yet, increased digitalization could give increase energy demand, thus wiping away potential efficiency 
benefits, unless appropriately governed (IPCC 2018a).  Moreover, digital technologies could negatively 
impact labour demand and increase inequality (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter).

Digital technologies impact positively and negatively GHG emissions through their own carbon 
footprint, via technology application for mitigation, and via induced larger social change.  Digital 
technologies  also  raise  broader  sustainability  concerns  due  to  their  use  of  rare  materials  and 
associated waste, and their potential negative impact on inequalities and labour demand. 

Direct impacts emerge because digital technologies consume large amounts of energy, but also 
have the potential to steeply  increase energy efficiency in all end-use sectors  through material 
input  savings  and  increased  coordination  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement)  (Horner  et  al. 
2016;  Jones  2018)  (Huang  et  al.  2016;  IEA  2017b).  Global  energy  demand  from  digital  appliances 
reached 7.14 EJ in 2018 (Chapter 9, Box 9.5), implying higher related carbon emissions. However, a 
small smart phone offers services previously requiring many different devices  (Grubler et al. 2018). 
Demand for data services is increasing rapidly; quantitative estimates of the growth of associated energy 
demand range from slow and marginal to rapid and sizeable, depending the efficiency trends of digital 
technologies (see Chapter 5.3.4.1)(Avgerinou et al. 2017; Stoll et al. 2019; Vranken 2017; Masanet et 
al. 2020).  Renewable energy  serves as low-carbon energy  provider  for the  operation  of  data  centre, 
which in turn can provide waste heat for other purposes. Digital technologies can markedly increase the 
energy efficiency of mobility and residential and public buildings, especially in the context of systems 
integration (IEA 2020a). Reduction in energy demand and associated GHG emissions from buildings 
and  industry  while  maintaining  service  levels  equal  is  estimated  at  5  to  10%,  with  larger  savings 
possible.  Approaches  include  building  energy  management  systems  (BEMS),  home  energy

management system (HEMS), demand response and smart charging (Cross-Chapter Box 11, Table 1. 
Data centres can also play a role in energy system management, e.g., by increasing renewable energy 
generation through predictive control (Dabbagh et al. 2019), and by helping drive the market for battery 
storage and fuel cells (Riekstin et al. 2014).  Temporal and spatial scheduling of electricity demand can 
provide about 10 GW in demand response in the European electricity system in 2030 (Koronen et al. 
2020; Wahlroos et al. 2017, 2018; Laine et al. 2020). 

However, system-wide effects may endanger energy and GHG emission savings (high evidence, 
high agreement). Economic growth resulting from higher energy and labour productivities can increase 
energy demand (Lange et al. 2020) and associated GHG emissions. Importantly, digitalization can also 
benefit carbon-intensive technologies (Victor 2018). Impacts on GHG emissions are varied in smart 
and shared mobility systems, as ride hailing increases GHG emissions due to deadheading, whereas 
shared pooled mobility and shared cycling reduce GHG emissions, as occupancy levels and/or weight 
per person km transported improve (Chapter 5, Section 5.3). Energy and GHG emissions impacts from 
the ubiquitous deployment of smart sensors and service optimization applications in smart cities through 
are insufficiently assessed in the literature (Milojevic-Dupont and Creutzig 2021). Systemic effects have 
wider boundaries of analysis, including broader environmental impacts (e.g. demand for rare materials, 
disposal of digital devices). These need to be integrated holistically within policy design (Kunkel and 
Matthess 2020), but they are difficult to quantify and investigate (Bieser and Hilty 2018). Policies and 
adequate  infrastructures  and  choice  architectures  can  help  manage  and  contain  the  negative 
repercussions of systemic effects (Section 5.4, 5.6, 9.9).

Broader societal impacts of digitalization can also influence climate mitigation because of induced 
demand for consumption goods, impacts on firms’ competitiveness, changes the demand for skills 
and labour, worsening of inequality – including reduced access to services due to the digital divide 
–  and  governance  aspects  (low  evidence,  medium  agreement)  (Chapter  4,  Section  4.4,  Chapter  5, 
Sections  5.3,  5.6).  Digital  technologies  expand  production  possibilities  in  sectors  other  than  ICTs 
through robotics, smart manufacturing, and 3D printing, and have major implications on consumption 
patterns (Matthess and Kunkel 2020). Initial evidence suggests that robots displace routine jobs and 
certain  skills,  change  the  demand  for  high-skilled  and  low-skilled  workers,  and  suppress  wages 
(Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019). Digitalization can thus reduce consumers’ liquidity and consumption 
(Mian et al. 2020) and contribute to global inequality, including across the gender dimension, raising 
fairness concerns (Kerras et al. 2020; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad 2021). Digital technologies can lead 
to additional concentration in economic power (e.g. Rikap 2020) and lower competition; open source

digital technologies can however counter this tendency (e.g. Rotz et al. 2019). Digital technologies play 
a role in mobilizing citizens for climate and sustainability actions (Westerhoff et al. 2018; Segerberg 
2017). 

Whether the digital revolution will be an enabler or a barrier for decarbonization will ultimately 
depend on the governance of both digital decarbonization pathways and digitalization more in 
general (medium evidence, high agreement). The understanding of the disruptive potential of the wide 
range of digital technologies is limited due to their ground-breaking nature, which makes it hard to 
extrapolate from previous history/experience. Municipal and national entities can make use of digital 
technologies to manage and govern energy use and GHG emissions in their jurisdiction (Bibri 2019a,b) 
and break down solution strategies to specific infrastructures, building, and places, relying on remote 
sensing and mapping data, and contextual (machine-) learning about their use (Milojevic-Dupont and 
Creutzig  2021).  Mobility  apps  can  provide  mobility-as-a-service  access  to  cities  ensuring  due 
preference to active and healthy modes (see 9.9 for the example of the Finnish city of Lahti). Trusted 
data governance can  promote the implementation of local climate solutions, supported by available big 
data  on  infrastructures  and  environmental  quality  (Hansen  and  Porter  2017;  Hughes  et  al.  2020). 
Governance decisions, such as taxing data, prohibiting surveillance technologies, or releasing data that 
enable accountability can change digitalization pathways, and thus underlying GHG emission (Hughes 
et al. 2020). 

Closing the digital gap in developing countries and rural communities enables an opportunity for 
leapfrogging (medium evidence, medium agreement). Communication technologies (such as mobile 
phones)  enable  participation  of  rural  communities,  especially  in  developing  countries,  and  promote 
technological leapfrogging, e.g. decentralized renewable energies and smart farming (Ugur and Mitra 
2017;  Foster  and  Azmeh  2020;  Arfanuzzaman  2021).  Digital  technologies  have  sector-specific 
potentials and barriers, and may benefit certain regions/areas/socioeconomic groups more than others. 
For example, integrated mobility services benefit cities more than rural and peripheral areas  (OECD 
2017).  

Appropriate mechanisms also need to be designed to govern digitalization as megatrend (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Digitalization is expected to be a fast process, but this transformation takes 
place  against  entrenched  individual  behaviours,  existing  infrastructure,  the  legacy  of  time  frames, 
vested  interest  and  slow  institutional  processes  and  requires  trust  from  consumers,  producers  and 
institutions. A core question relates to who controls and manages data created by everyday operations 
(calls, shopping, weather data, service use, etc.). Regulations that limit or ban the expropriation and 
exploitation of behavioural data, sourced via smart phones, represent crucial aspects in digitalization 
pathways, alongside the possibility to create climate movements and political pressure from the civil 
society.  Governance  mechanisms  need  to  be  developed  to  ensure  that  digital  technologies  such  as 
artificial intelligence take over ethical choices  (Craglia et al. 2018; Rahwan et al. 2019). Appropriate 
governance  is  necessary  for  digitalization  effectively  work  in  tandem  with  established  mitigation 
technologies and choice architectures. Consideration of system-wide effects and overall management 
is essential to avoid run-away effects. Overall governance of digitalization remains a challenge, and 
will have large-scale repercussions on energy demand and GHG emissions.

16.2.2.4   Explaining past and projecting future technology cost changes 

Researchers and policymakers alike are interested in using observed empirical patterns of learning to 
project  future  reductions  in  costs  of  technologies.  Studies  cutting  across  a  wide  range  of  industrial 
sectors (not just energy) have tried to relate cost reductions to different functional forms, including cost 
reductions  as  a  function  of  time  (Moore’s  law)  and  cost  reductions  as  a  function  of  production  or

deployment (Wright’s law, also known as Henderson's law), finding that those two forms perform better 
than  alternatives  combining  different  factors,  with  costs  as  a  function  of  production  (Wright’s  law) 
performing marginally better (Nagy et al. 2013). A comparison of expert elicitation and model-based 
forecasts of the future cost of technologies for the energy transition indicates that model-based forecast 
medians were closer to the average realized values in 2019 (Meng et al. 2021). 

Recent studies attempt to separate the influence of learning-by-doing (which is a basis of Wright’s law) 
versus  other  factors  in  explaining  cost  reductions  specifically  in  energy  technologies.  Some  studies 
explain cost reductions with two factors: cumulative deployment (as proxy for experience) and R&D 
investment (see the “two factor” learning curve (Klaassen et al. 2005). However, reliable information 
on public energy R&D investments for developing countries is not systematically collected. Available 
data for  OECD countries cannot be precisely assigned to specific industrial sectors or sub-technologies 
(Verdolini  et  al.  2018).  Some  learning-curve  studies  take  into  account  that  historical  variation  in 
technology costs could be explained by variation in key materials and fuel costs (for example steel costs 
for wind turbines (Qiu and Anadon 2012) silicon costs (Kavlak et al. 2018; Nemet 2006)  coal and coal 
plant construction costs (McNerney et al. 2011). Economies of scale played a significant role in the 
PV cost reductions since the early 2000s (Yu et al. 2011) (See also Box 16.4), which can also be the 
case in organic PV technologies (Gambhir et al. 2016; Kavlak et al. 2018). 

16.2.3  Directing technological change 

Technological change is characterized not only by its speed, but also its direction. The early works that 
considered the role of technology in economic and productivity growth (Solow 1957; Nelson and Phelps 
1966) assumed that technology can move forward along only one dimension - every improvement led 
to  an increase  in  efficiency  and  increased  demand for  all  factors of  production.  This  view  however 
ignores the potency of technological  change  to  alter the  otherwise  fixed  relation  between  economic 
growth and the use of resources.  

Technological  change  that  saves  fossil  fuels  could  decouple  economic  growth  and  CO2  emissions 
(Acemoglu et al. 2014; Hémous 2016; Greaker et al. 2018; Acemoglu et al. 2012).  Saving of fossils 
could be obtained with increasing efficiency of producing alternatives to fossils (Acemoglu et al. 2012, 
2014). This is the case of oil consumption by combustion engine cars which could be substituted with 
electric cars (Aghion et al. 2013). If there is no close substitute to dirty resource, then its intensity in 
production could still be reduced by increasing efficiency of the dirty resource relative to efficiency of 
other  inputs  (Hassler  et al.  2012;  André  and  Smulders  2014; Witajewski-Baltvilks  et  al.  2017).  For 
instance, energy efficiency improvement leads to drop in relative demand for energy (Hassler et al. 
2012; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017). 

16.2.3.1  Determinants of technological change direction: prices, market size and government 

Firms change their choice of technology upon change in prices: when one input (e.g. energy) becomes 
relatively expensive, firms pick technologies which allow them to economize on that input, according 
to  price-induced  technological  change  theory  (Reder  and  Hicks  1965;  Samuelson  1965;  Sue  Wing 
2006).  For  example,  an  increase  in  oil price  will lead  to  a  choice  of  fuel-saving  technologies.  Such 
response of technological change was evident during the oil-price shocks in the 1970s (Hassler et al. 
2012). Technological change that is induced by an increase in price of a resource can never lead to an 
increase in use of that resource. In other words, rebound effects associated induced technological change 
can never offset the saving effect of that technological change (Antosiewicz and Witajewski-Baltvilks 
2021).  

The  impact  of  energy  prices  on  the  size  of  low-carbon  technological  change  is  supported  by  large 
number  of  empirical  studies  (Popp  2019;  Grubb  and  Wieners  2020).  Studies  document  that  higher

energy  prices are  associated  with  higher  number  of  low-carbon  energy  or  energy  efficiency  patents 
(Noailly  and  Smeets  2015;  Ley  et  al.  2016;  Lin  and  Chen  2019;  Newell  et  al.  1999;  Popp  2002; 
Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017; Verdolini and Galeotti 2011). Sue Wing (2008) finds that innovation 
induced by energy prices had a minor impact on the decline in U.S. energy intensity in the last decades 
of 20th century and that autonomous technological change played a more important role. Several studies 
explore the impact of a carbon tax on green innovation (see Section 16.4). However, disentangling the 
effect of policy tools is complex because presence of some policies could distort the functioning of 
other policies (Böhringer and Rosendahl 2010; Fischer et al. 2017) and because the impact of policies 
could be lagged in time (Antosiewicz and Witajewski-Baltvilks 2021). 

The direction of technological change depends also on the market size for dirty technologies relative to 
the size of other  markets  (Acemoglu  et  al.  2014).  Due  to  this  dependence,  climate  and  trade  policy 
choices in a single region can alter the direction of technological change at the global level (see Section 
16.2.3.3). 

The value of the market for clean technologies is determined not only by a current but also by firm’s 
expectations of future stream of profits (Alkemade and Suurs 2012; Greaker et al. 2018; Aghion 2019). 
One  implication  is  that  bolstering  the  credibility  and  durability  of  policies  related  to  low-carbon 
technology is crucial to accelerating technological change and inducing the private sector investment 
required (Helm et al. 2003), especially in rapidly growing economies of Asia and Africa who are on the 
brink of making major decisions about the type of infrastructure they build as they grow, develop, and 
industrialize (Nemet et al. 2017).  

If  governments  commit  to  climate  policies,  firms  expect  that  the  future  size  of  markets  for  clean 
technologies will be large and they are eager to redirect research effort towards development of these 
technologies  today.  Furthermore  the  commitment  would  also  incentivise  acquiring  skills  that  could 
further reduce the costs of those technologies (Aghion 2019). However, historical evidence shows that 
policies related to energy and climate over the long term have tended to change  (Nemet et al. 2013; 
Taylor 2012; Koch et al. 2016). Still, where enhancing policy durability has proven infeasible, multiple 
uncorrelated potentially overlapping policies can provide sufficient incentives (Nemet 2010).  

16.2.3.2  Determinants of direction of technological change: financial markets 

The challenges of investing in innovation in energy when compared to other important areas, such as 
IT and medicine are also reflected in the trends in venture capital funding. Research found that early-
stage  investments  in  clean-tech  companies  were  more  likely  to  fail  and  returned  less  capital  than 
comparable investments in software and medical technology (Gaddy et al. 2017), which led to a retreat 
from investors from hardware technologies required for renewable energy generation and storage to 
software based technologies and demand-side solutions (Bumpus and Comello 2017). 

The  preference  for  particular  types  of  investments  in  renewable  energy  technologies  depends  on 
investors  attitude  to  risk  (Mazzucato  and  Semieniuk  2018).  Some  investors  invest  in  only  one 
technology, others may spread their investments, or invest predominantly in high-risk technologies. The 
distribution of different types of investors will affect whether finance goes to support deployment of 
new  high-risk  technologies,  or  diffusion  of  more  mature,  less-risky  technologies  characterized  by 
incremental innovations. The role of finance in directing investment is further discussed in Chapter 15, 
Section 15.6.2. 

16.2.3.3  Internationalization of green technological change 

A unilateral effort to reduce emission (via a combination of climate, industrial and trade policies) in a 
coalition of regions that are technology leaders will reduce cost of clean technologies, which will induce 
emission reduction in the countries outside the coalition (Di Maria and Smulders 2005; Di Maria and 
van der Werf 2008; van den Bijgaart 2017; Golombek and Hoel 2004; Hémous 2016). The literature

suggests various mechanisms leading to this result. Di Maria and van der Werf (2008) argues that the 
effort to reduce emission in one region reduces global demand for dirty good. This will redirect global 
innovation towards clean technologies, leading to drop in cost of clean production in every region.  

The model in Hemous (2016) predict that the coalition could induce acceleration of clean technological 
change  with  a  mix  of  carbon  tax,  clean  R&D  subsidies  and  trade  policies  in  that  region  leading  to 
reduction  of  cost  of  clean  production  inside  the  coalition.  Export  of  goods  produced  with  clean 
technologies to a region outside the coalition reduces demand for dirty good in that region. In the model 
by van den Bijgaart (2017) local advancements of clean technologies by a coalition with strong R&D 
potential  are  imitated  outside  the  coalition.  Furthermore,  advancements  of  clean  technologies  will 
incentivise  future  clean  R&D  outside  the  coalition  due  to  intertemporal  knowledge  spillovers.  In 
Golombek and Hoel (2004) increase in environmental concern in one region increases abatement R&D 
in that region. Part of this knowledge spills over to other regions, increasing their incentive to increase 
abatement too, providing the latter regions did not invest in abatement before.  

However,  this  chain  breaks  if  the  regions  that  are  behind  technological  frontier  (i.e.,  technological 
followers) are not able to absorb the solutions developed by regions at the frontier. New technologies 
might fail due to deficiencies of political, commercial, industrial, and financial institutions, which we 
list in table 16.4. For instance, countries might not benefit fully from international knowledge spillover 
due  to  insufficient  domestic  R&D  investment,  since  local  knowledge  is  needed  to  determine  the 
appropriateness of technologies for the local market, adapting them, installing and using effectively 
(Gruebler et al. 2012). From the policy perspective this implies that simple transfer of technologies 
could be insufficient to guarantee adoption of new technologies (Gruebler et al. 2012).

behind technological frontier.

Research relying on patent citations has indicated that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a mechanism 
for firms to both contribute to the recipient country’s innovation output as well as benefitting from the 
recipient  country  both  in  industrialized  countries  (Branstetter  2006)  and  in  developing  countries 
(Newman et al. 2015). However, insights specific for energy or climate change mitigation areas are not 
available, nor is there much information about how other innovation metrics may react to FDI.  

Finally, technologies could be not efficient in developing countries even if they are efficient in countries 
at  the  technological  frontier.  For  instance,  technologies  that  are  highly  capital  intensive  and  labour 
saving will be efficient only in countries where costs of capital are low and costs of labour are high. 
Similarly,  technologies  which  require  large  number  of  skilled  labour  will  be  more  competitive  in  a

country where skilled labour is abundant (and hence cheap) than where it is scarce  (Basu and Weil 
1998; Caselli and Coleman 2006). 

16.2.3.4  Market failures in directing technological change 

Market forces alone cannot deliver Pareto optimal (i.e. socially efficient) due to at least two types of 
externalities: GHG emissions that cause climate damage and knowledge spillovers that benefit firms 
other  than  the  inventor.  Nordhaus  (2011)  argues  that  these  two  problems  would  have  to  be  tackled 
separately: once the favourable intellectual property right regimes (i.e. the laws  or rules or regulation 
on protection and enforcement) are in place, a price on carbon that corrects the emission externality is 
sufficient to induce optimal level of green technological change. Acemoglu et al. (2012) demonstrates 
that subsidizing clean technologies (and not dirty ones) is also necessary to break the lock-in of dirty 
technological  change.  Recommendations  for  technical  changes  often  are  based  on  climate 
considerations only and neglect secondary externalities and environmental costs of technology choices 
(such as loss of biodiversity due to inappropriate scale-up of bioenergy use). The scale of adverse side 
effects  and  co-benefits  varies  considerably  between  low-carbon  technologies  in  the  energy  sector 
(Luderer et al. 2019). 

16.2.4  Representation of the innovation process in modelled decarbonization pathways 

A variety of models are used to generate climate mitigation pathways, compatible with 2°C and well 
below  2°C  targets.  These  include  Integrated  Assessment  Models  (IAMs),  energy  system  models, 
computable general equilibrium models and agent based models. They range from global (Chapter 3) 
to national models and include both top-down and bottom-up approaches (Chapter 4). Innovation in 
energy  technologies,  which  comprises  the  development  and  diffusion  of  low-,  zero-  and  negative-
carbon energy options, but also investments to increase energy efficiency, is a key driver of emissions 
reductions in model-based scenarios.  

16.2.4.1  Technology cost development 

Assumptions on energy technology cost developments are one of the factors that determine the speed 
and magnitude of the deployment in climate-energy-economy models. The modelling is informed by 
the  empirical  literature  estimating  rates of  cost reductions  for energy technologies.  A  first strand  of 
literature relies on the extrapolation of historical data, assuming that costs decrease either as a power 
law of cumulative production, exponentially with time (Nagy et al. 2013) or as a function of technical 
performance metrics (Koh and Magee 2008). Another approach relies on expert estimates of how future 
costs will evolve, including expert elicitations (Verdolini et al. 2018). 

In these models, technology costs may evolve exogenously or endogenously (Krey et al. 2019; Mercure 
et al. 2016). In the first case, technology costs are assumed to vary over time at some predefined rate, 
generally extrapolated from past observed patterns or based on expert estimates. This formulation of 
cost dynamics generally underestimates future costs (Meng et al. 2021) as, among other things, it does 
not capture any policy-induced carbon-saving technological change or any spillover arising from the 
accumulation  of  national  and  international  knowledge  (Section  16.2.2  and  16.2.3)  or  positive 
macroeconomics effects of a transition (Karkatsoulis et al. 2016). The influence of cost and diffusion 
assumptions may be evaluated through sensitivity analysis.  In the second case, costs are a function of 
a  choice  variable  within  the  model.  For  instance,  technology  costs  decrease  as  a  function  of  either 
cumulative installed capacity (learning-by-doing) (Seebregts et al. 1998; Kypreos and Bahn 2003) or 
R&D investments or spillovers from other sectors and countries.  

One factor in this ‘learning-by-researching’ is applied to a wide range of energy technologies but also 
to model improvements in the efficiency of energy use (Goulder and Schneider 1999; Popp 2004). More 
complex formulations include two-factor learning processes (see Section 16.2.2.1) (Criqui et al. 2015;

Emmerling et al. 2016; Paroussos et al. 2020), multi-factor learning curves (Kahouli 2011; Yu et al. 
2011), or other drivers of cost reductions such as economies of scale and markets (Elia et al. 2021). The 
application of two-factor learning curves to model energy technology costs is often constrained by the 
lack  of information  on public  and/or  private energy  R&D  investments in many fast-developing  and 
developing  countries  (Verdolini  et  al.  2018).  The  approach  used  to  model  energy  technology  costs 
reductions varies across technologies, even within the same model, depending on the availability of 
data and/or the level of maturity. Less mature technologies generally depend highly on learning-by-
research, whereas learning-by-doing dominates in more mature technologies (Jamasb 2007).  

In  addition  to  learning,  knowledge  spillover  effects  are  also  integrated  in  climate-energy-economy 
models  to  reflect  the  fact  that  innovation  in  a  given  country  depends  also  on  knowledge  generated 
elsewhere (Fragkiadakis et al. 2020; Emmerling et al. 2016). Models with a more detailed representation 
of sectors (Paroussos et al. 2020) can use spillover matrices to include bilateral spillovers and compute 
learning rates that depend on the human capital stock and the regional and/or sectoral absorption rates 
(Fragkiadakis et al. 2020). Accounting for knowledge spillovers in the EU for PV, wind turbines, EVs, 
biofuels,  industry  materials,  batteries  and  advanced  heating  and  cooking  appliances  can  lead  to  the 
following results in a decarbonization scenario over the period 2020–2050 as compared to the reference 
scenario: an increase of 1.0–1.4% in GDP, 2.1–2.3% in investment, and 0.2–0.4% in employment by 
clean  energy  technologies  (Paroussos  et  al.  2017).  When  comparing  two  possible  EU  transition 
strategies  -  being  a  first-mover  with  strong  unilateral  emission  reduction  strategy  until  2030  versus 
postponing action for the period after 2030 - endogenous technical progress in the green technologies 
sector can alleviates most of the negative effects of pioneering low-carbon transformation associated 
with loss of competitiveness and carbon leakage (Karkatsoulis et al. 2016). 

16.2.4.2  Technology deployment and diffusion 

To simulate possible paths of energy technology diffusion for different decarbonisation targets, models 
rely on assumptions about the cost of a given technology cost relative to the costs of other technologies 
and its ability to supply the energy demand under the relevant energy system and physical constraints. 
These assumptions include, for example, considerations regarding renewable intermittency, inertia on 
technology lifetime (for instance, under less stringent temperature scenarios early retirement of fossil 
plants does not take place), distribution, capacity and market growth constraints, as well as the presence 
of policies. These factors change the relative price of technologies. Furthermore, technological diffusion 
in one country is also influenced by technology advancements in other regions (Kriegler et al. 2015). 

Technology diffusion may also be strongly influenced, either positively or negatively, by a number of 
non-cost,  non-technological  barriers  or  enablers  regarding  behaviours,  society  and  institutions 
(Knobloch and Mercure 2016)These include network or infrastructure externalities, the co-evolution of 
technology clusters over time (“path dependence”), the risk-aversion of users, personal preferences and 
perceptions and lack of adequate institutional framework which may negatively influence the speed of 
(low-carbon) technological innovation and diffusion, heterogeneous agents with different preferences 
or  expectations,  multi-objectives  and/or  competitiveness  advantages  and  uncertainty  around  the 
presence and the level of environmental policies and institutional and administrative barriers (Iyer et al. 
2015;  Baker  et  al.  2015; Marangoni  and  Tavoni  2014;  van  Sluisveld  et  al.  2020;  Napp  et  al.  2017; 
Biresselioglu et al. 2020). These types of barriers to technology diffusion are currently not explicitly 
detailed  in  most  of  the  climate-energy-economy  models.  Rather,  they  are  accounted  for  in  models 
through scenario narratives, such as the ones in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (Riahi et al. 2017), 
in  which  assumptions  about  technology  adoption  are  spanned  over  a  plausible  range  of  values. 
Complementary  methods  are  increasingly  used  to  explore  their  importance  in  future  scenarios 
(Turnheim et al. 2015; Gambhir et al. 2019; Trutnevyte et al. 2019; Doukas et al. 2018; Geels et al. 
2016). It takes a very complex modelling framework to include all aspects affecting technology cost 
reductions  and  technology  diffusion,  such  as  heterogeneous  agents  (Lamperti  et  al.  2020),  regional

labour  costs  (Skelton  et  al.  2020),  materials  cost  and  trade  and  perfect  foresight  multi-objective 
optimization  (Aleluia  Reis  et  al.  2021).  So  far,  no  model  can  account  for  all  these  interactions 
simultaneously.  

Another key aspect of decarbonization regards issues of acceptability and social inclusion in decision-
making. Participatory processes involving stakeholders can be implemented using several methods to 
incorporate qualitative elements in model-based scenarios on future change (Doukas and Nikas 2020; 
van Vliet et al. 2010; Nikas et al. 2017, 2018; van der Voorn et al. 2020).  

16.2.4.3   Implications for the modelling of technical change in decarbonization pathways 

Although  the  debate  is  still  ongoing,  preliminary  conclusions  indicate  that    integrated  assessment 
models tend to underestimate innovation on energy supply but overestimate the contributions by energy 
efficiency (IPCC 2018b). Scenarios emerging from cost-optimal climate-energy-economy models are 
too pessimistic, especially in the case of rapidly changing technologies such as wind and batteries in 
the past decade  Conversely, they tend be too optimistic regarding the timing of action, or the availability 
of  a  given  technology  and  its  speed  of  diffusion  (Shiraki  and  Sugiyama  2020).  Furthermore,  some 
technological and economic transformations may emerge as technically feasible from IAMs, but are not 
realistic if taking into account political economy, international politics, human behaviours, and cultural 
factors (Bosetti 2021).  

There is a range of projected energy technology supply costs included in the AR6 Scenario Database 
(Box 16.1). Variations of costs over time and across scenarios are within ranges comparable to those 
observed in recent years. Conversely, model results show that limiting warming to 2°C or 1.5°C will 
require faster  diffusion  of installed capacity  of low-carbon  energy  options  and a  rapid  phase  out  of 
fossil-based  options.  This  points  to  the  importance  of  focusing  on  overcoming  real-life  barriers  to 
technology deployment.

Box 16.1 Comparing observed energy technology costs and deployment rates with projections 
from AR6 low-carbon pathways 

Currently observed costs and deployment for electricity supply technologies from a variety of sources 
are  compared  with  projections  from  two  different  sets  of  scenarios  contained  in  the  AR6  Scenario 
database: 1) reference and current policies including NDCs and 2) 2°C and well-below 2°C (AR6 model 
database). Global aggregate costs are shown for the following technologies: Coal with CCS, Gas with 
CCS, Nuclear, Solar PV, Onshore and Offshore Wind.  

The  decrease  in  forecasted  capital  costs  is  not  large  compared  to  current  capital  costs  for  most 
technologies, and does not differ much between the two scenarios (Box 16.1, Figure 1a). For Wind 
offshore  some  of  the  models  are  more  optimistic  than  the  current  reality  (Timilsina  2020).  Several 
sources  of  current  solar  PV  costs  report  values  that  are  at  the  low  end  of  the  AR6  model  scenario 
database. By 2050, the median technology cost forecasts decrease by between 5% for nuclear and 45-
52% for solar (Box 16.1, Figure 1c).  

Median  values  of  renewables  installed  capacity  increase  with  respect  to  2020  capacity  in  “current 
policies” scenarios (Box 16.1, Figure 1b), where energy and climate policies are implemented in line 
with the current NDCs. More ore stringent targets (2°C) are achieved through a higher deployment of 
renewable technologies: by 2050 solar (wind) capacity is estimated to increase by a factor of 15 (10) 
(Box  16.1,  Figure  1c).  This  is  accompanied  by  an  almost  complete  phase  out  of  coal  (-87%).  The 
percentage of median changes in installed capacity in the current policies scenarios is within comparable

ranges of that observed in the last decade. In the case of the 2°C and well-below 2°C scenarios, capacity 
installed is  higher for renewable technologies and nuclear, and lower for fossil-based technologies (Box 
16.1, Figure 1c). 

The  higher  deployment  in  2°C  scenarios  cannot  be  explained  solely  as  a  result  of  technology  cost 
dynamics. In IAMs, technology deployment is also governed by system constraints that characterize 
both scenarios, e.g. the flexibility of the energy system, the availability of storage technologies. From a 
modelling point of view, implementing more stringent climate policies to meet the 2°C targets forces 
models  to  find  solutions,  even  if  costly,  to  meet  those  intermittency  and  flexibility  constraints  and 
temperature target constraints.

16.3 A systemic view of technological innovation processes 

The innovation process, which consists of a set of sequential phases (Section 16.2.1), is often simplified 
to a linear process. Yet, it is now well understood that it is also characterised by numerous kinds of 
interactions and feedbacks between the domains of knowledge generation, knowledge translation and 
application, and knowledge use (Kline and Rosenberg 1986). Furthermore, it is not just invention that 
leads to technological change but the cumulative contribution of incremental innovations over time can 
be very significant (Kline and Rosenberg 1986). Innovations can come not just from formal R&D but 
also sources such as production engineers and the shop floor (Freeman 1995a; Kline and Rosenberg 
1986).  

This section reviews the literature focusing on innovation as a systemic process. This now predominant 
view enriches the understanding of innovation as presented in section 16.2; it conceptualizes innovation 
as the result of actions by, and interactions among, a large set of actors, whose activities are shaped by, 
and shape, the context in which they operate and the user group with which they are engaging. This 
section  aligns  with  the  discussion  of  socio-technical  transitions  (see  Chapter  1  Section  1.7.3,  the 
Supplementary Material in Chapter 5, and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter).  

16.3.1  Frameworks for analysing technological innovation processes 

The resulting overarching framework that is commonly used in the innovation scholarship and even 
policy analyses is termed as “innovation system”, where the key constituents of the systems are actors, 
their interactions, and the institutional landscape, including formal rules, such as laws, and informal 
restraints, such as culture and codes of conduct, that govern the behaviour of the actors (North 1991). 

One application of this framework is that of national innovation systems (NIS), which highlights the 
importance  of  national  and  regional  relationships  for  determining  the  technological  and  industrial 
capabilities  and  development  of  a  country  (Nelson  1993;  Lundvall  1992;  Freeman  1995a).  Nelson 
(1993) and Freeman (Freeman 1995a) highlight the role of institutions that determine the innovative 
performance of national firms as way to understand differences across countries, while Lundvall (1992) 
focuses on the “elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, 
and  economically  useful,  knowledge”,  i.e.,  notions  of  interactive  learning,  in  which  user-producer 
relationships are particularly important (Lundvall 1988). Building on this, various other applications of 
the “innovation systems” framework have emerged in the literature.   

Technological  Innovation  systems  (TIS),  with  technology  or  set  of  technologies  (more  narrowly  or 
broadly defined in different cases) as the unit of analysis and focus on explaining what accelerates or 
hinders  their  development  and  diffusion.  Carlsson  and  Stankiewicz  (1991)  define  a  technological 
system  as  “a  dynamic  network  of  agents  interacting  in  a  specific  economic/  industrial  area  under  a 
particular  institutional  infrastructure  and  involved  in  the  generation,  diffusion,  and  utilisation  of 
technology.” More recent work takes a “functional approach” to TIS (Bergek et al. 2008; Hekkert et al. 
2007),  which  was  later  expanded  with  explanations  of  how  some  of  the  sectoral,  geographical  and 
political dimensions intersect with technology innovation systems (Bergek et al. 2015; Quitzow 2015).

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Sectoral innovation systems (SIS): based on the understanding that the constellation of relevant actors 
and  institutions  will  vary  across  industrial  sectors,  with  each  sector  operating  under  a  different 
technological regime and under different competitive or market conditions. A sectoral innovation, thus, 
can be defined as “that system (group) of firms active in developing and making a sector's products and 
in generating and utilising a sector's technologies” (Breschi and Malerba 1997).  

Regional and Global innovation systems (RIS, GIS), recognising that the many innovation processes 
have  a  spatial  dimension,  where  the  development  of  system  resources  such  as  knowledge,  market 
access,  financial  investment,  and  technology  legitimacy  may  well  draw  on  actors,  networks,  and 
institutions  within a  region  (Cooke  et  al.  1997).  In  other  cases,  the  distribution of  many innovation 
processes are highly internationalised and therefore outside specific territorial boundaries  (Binz and 
Truffer  2017).  Importantly,  Binz  and  Truffer  (2017)  note  that  the  GIS  framework  “differentiates 
between  an  industry’s  dominant innovation mode... and  the  economic system  of  valuation  in  which 
markets for the innovation are constructed.” 

Mission-oriented innovation systems (MIS), whose relevance comes into focus with the move towards 
mission-oriented  programs  as  part  of  the  increasing  innovation  policy  efforts  to  address  societal 
challenges. Accordingly, an MIS is seen as consisting of “networks of agents and sets of institutions 
that contribute to the development and diffusion of innovative solutions with the aim to define, pursue 
and complete a societal mission” (Hekkert et al. 2020).  

Notably the innovation systems approach has been used in a number of climate-relevant areas such as 
agriculture (Echeverría 1998; Klerkx et al. 2012; Horton and Mackay 2003; Brooks and Loevinsohn 
2011), energy (Sagar and Holdren 2002; OECD 2006; Gallagher et al. 2012; Wieczorek et al. 2013; 
Mignon and Bergek 2016; Darmani et al. 2014), industry (Koasidis et al. 2020b) and transport (Koasidis 
et al. 2020a), and sustainable development (Clark et al. 2016; Bryden and Gezelius 2017; Anadon et al. 
2016b; Nikas et al. 2020). 

A number of functions can be used to understand and characterise the performance of technological 
innovation systems (Hekkert et al. 2007; Bergek et al. 2008). The most common functions are in Table 
16.5.

Evidence from empirical case studies indicates that all the above functions are important and that they 
interact with one another (Hekkert and Negro 2009). The approach therefore serves as both a rationale 
for and a guide to innovation policy (Bergek et al. 2010).  

A much-used, complementary systemic framework is the multilevel perspective (MLP) (Geels 2002), 
which focuses mainly on the diffusion of technologies in relation to incumbent technologies in their 
sector  and  the  overall  economy.  A  key  point  of  MLP  is  that  new  technologies  need  to  establish 
themselves in a stable ‘socio-technical regime’ and are therefore generally at a disadvantage, not just 
because  their  low  technological  maturity,  but  also  because  of  an  unwelcoming  system.  The  MLP 
highlights  that  the  uptake  of  technologies  in  society  is  an  evolutionary  process,  which  can  be  best 
understood  as  a  combination  of  “variation,  selection  and  retention”  as  well  as  “unfolding  and 
reconfiguration”  (Geels  2002).  Thus  new  technologies  in  their  early  stages  need  to  be  selected  and 
supported at the micro-level by niche markets, possibly through a directed process that has been termed 
“strategic  niche  management”  (Kemp  et  al.  1998).  As  at  the  macro  landscape  level  pressures  on 
incumbent regimes mount, and those regimes destabilise, the niche technologies get a chance to get 
established  in  a  new  socio-technical  regime,  which  allows  these technologies to  grow  and  stabilise, 
shaping a changed or sometimes radically renewed socio-technical regime. The MLP takes a systematic 
and comprehensive view about how to nurture and shape technological transitions by understanding 
them as evolutionary, multi-directional and cumulative socio-technical process playing out at multiple 
levels over time with a concomitant expansion in the scale and scope of the transition (Elzen et al. 2004; 
Geels 2005b). There have been numerous studies that draw on the MLP (van Bree et al. 2010; Geels et 
al. 2017; Geels 2012) to understand different aspects of climate technology innovation and diffusion. 

Systemic analyses of innovation have predominantly focused on industrialised countries   There have 
been some efforts to use the innovation systems lens for the developing country context (Jacobsson and 
Bergek 2006; Lundvall et al. 2009; Altenburg 2009; Choi and Zo 2019; Tigabu 2018; Tigabu et al. 
2015)  and  specific  suggestions  on  ways  for  developing  countries  to  strengthening  their  innovation 
systems  (e.g.,  by  universities  taking  on  a  “developmental”  role  (Arocena  et  al.  2015)  or  industry 
associations acting as intermediaries to build institutional capacities (Watkins et al. 2015; Khan et al. 
2020), including specifically for addressing climate challenges (Sagar et al. 2009; Ockwell and Byrne 
2016).  But  the  conditions  in  developing  countries  are  quite  different,  leading  to  suggestions  that 
different theoretical conceptualisations of the innovation systems approach may be needed for these 
countries (Arocena and Sutz 2020), although a system perspective would still be appropriate (Boodoo 
et al. 2018).  

16.3.2  Identifying systemic failures to innovation in climate-related technologies 

Traditional perspectives on innovation policy were mostly science-driven, and focused on strengthening 
invention and its translation into application in a narrow sense, and a second main traditional perspective 
on innovation policy was focused on correcting for ‘market failures’ (covered in Section 16.2) (Weber 
and Truffer 2017). The more recent understanding of, and shift of focus to, the systemic nature on the 
innovation  and  diffusion  of  technologies  has  implications  for  innovation  policy  since  innovation 
outcomes  depend  not just on  inputs  such  as  R&D  but  much more  on the  functioning of the  overall 
innovation  system  (see  previous  section  and  Section  16.4).  Policies  can  therefore  be  directed  at

innovation  systems  components  and  processes  that  need  the  greatest  attention  or  support.  This  may 
include, for example, strengthening the capabilities of weak actors and improving interactions between 
actors (Jacobsson et al. 2017; Weber and Truffer 2017). At the same time, a systemic perspective also 
brings into sharp relief the notion of ‘system failures’ (Weber and Truffer 2017). 

Systemic failures include infrastructural failures; hard (e.g., laws, regulation) and soft (e.g., culture, 
social norms) institutional failures; interaction failures (strong and weak network failures); capability 
failures relating to firms and other actors; lock-in; and directional, reflexivity, and coordination failures 
(Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005; Chaminade and Esquist 2010; Weber and Rohracher 2012; Wieczorek 
and  Hekkert  2012;  Negro  et  al.  2012).  By  far  most  of  the  literature  that  unpacks  such  failures  and 
explores  ways  to  overcome  them  is  on  energy-related  innovation  policy.  For  example,  Table  16.6 
summarizes a meta-study (Negro et al. 2012) that examined cases of renewable energy technologies 
trying to disrupt incumbents across a range of countries to understand the roles, and relative importance, 
of the ‘systemic problems’ highlighted in Section 16.3.1.

Depending  on  the  sector,  specific  technology  characteristics,  and  national  and  regional  context,  the 
relevance of these systemic problems varies (Trianni et al. 2013; Bauer et al. 2017; Wesseling and Van 
der Vooren 2017; Koasidis et al. 2020b,a), suggesting that the innovation policy mix has to be tailor-
made to respond to the diversity of systemic failures (Rogge et al. 2017). An illustration of how such 
systemic failures have been addressed is given in Box 16.2, which shows how the Indian government 
designed its standards and labelling programme for energy-efficient air conditioners and refrigerators. 
The success of this program resulted from the careful attention to bring on board and coordinate the 
relevant actors and resources, the design of the standards, and ensuring effective administration and 
enforcement of the standards (Malhotra et al. 2021).

Box 16.2: Standards and Labelling (S&L) for energy efficient refrigerators and air conditioners 
in India2 

Energy efficiency is often characterised as a “low-hanging fruit” for reducing energy use. However, 
systemic  failures  such  as  lack  of  access  to  capital,  hidden  costs  of  implementation,  and  imperfect 
information can result in low investments into adoption and innovation in energy efficiency measures 
(Sorrell et al. 2004). To address such barriers, India’s governmental Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) 
introduced  the  Standards  and  Labelling  (S&L)  programme  for  promotion  of  innovation  in  energy 
efficient  appliances  in  2006  (Sundaramoorthy  and  Walia  2017).  While  context-dependent,  the 
programme design, policies and scale-up contain lessons for addressing systemic failures elsewhere too.  

Program design and addressal of early systemic barriers 

To design the S&L program, BEE drew on the international experiences and technical expertise of the 
Collaborative Labelling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP) – a non-profit organisation that 
provides technical and policy support to governments in implementing S&L programs. For example, 
since there was no data on the efficiency of appliances in the Indian market, CLASP assisted with early 
data collection efforts, resulting in a focus on refrigerators and air conditioners (ACs) (McNeil et al. 
2008).

Besides drawing from international knowledge, the involvement of manufacturers, testing laboratories, 
and customers was crucial for the functioning of the innovation system. 

To  involve  manufacturers,  BEE  employed  three  strategies  to  set  the  standards  at  an  ambitious  yet 
acceptable  level.  First,  BEE  enlisted  IIT  Delhi  (a  public  technical  university)  to  engage  with 
manufacturers and to demonstrate cost-effective designs of energy-efficient appliances. Second, BEE 
agreed  to  make  the  standards  voluntary  from  2006  to  2010.  In  return,  the  manufacturers  agreed  to 
mandatory and progressively more stringent standards starting in 2010. Third, BEE established a multi-
stakeholder  committee  with  representation  from  BEE,  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Standards,  appliance 
manufacturers, test laboratories, independent experts, and consumer groups (Jairaj et al. 2016) to ensure 
that adequately stringent standards are negotiated every two years. 

At this time, India had virtually no capacity for independent testing of appliances. Here too, BEE used 
multiple  approaches  towards  creating  the  actors  and  resources  needed  for  the  innovation  system  to 
function. First, BEE funded the Central Power Research Institute (CPRI)  – a national laboratory for 
applied research, testing and certification of electrical equipment – to set up refrigerator and AC testing 
facilities.  Second,  they  invited  bids  from  private  laboratories,  thus  creating  a  demand  for  testing 
facilities. Third, BEE developed testing protocols in partnership with universities. Australian standards 
for testing frost-free refrigerators were adopted until local standards were developed. Thus, once the 
testing  laboratories,  protocols  and  benchmark  prices  for  testing  were  in  place,  the  appliance 
manufacturers could employ their services. 

Finally, a customer outreach program was conducted from 2006 to 2008 to inform customers regarding 
energy  efficient  appliances,  to  enable  them  to  interpret  the  labels  correctly,  and  to  understand  their 
purchase decisions and information sources (Joshi et al. 2019; Jain et al. 2018). BEE initiated a capacity 
building program for retailers to be an information source for costumers. A comprehensive document 
with details of different models and labels was provided to retailers, together with a condensed booklet 
to be shared with customers. 

Adapting policies to technologies and local context 

While  many  of  India’s  standards  and  testing  protocols  were  based  on  international  standards,  they 
needed to be adapted to the Indian context. For example, because of higher temperatures in India, the 
reference outside temperature of 32°C for refrigerators was changed to 36°C. 

AC testing protocols also had to be adapted because of the emergence of inverter-based ACs. Existing 
testing done only at a single temperature did not value inverter-based ACs’ better average performance 
as  compared  to  fixed-speed  ACs  over  a  range  of  temperatures.  Thus,  the  Indian  Seasonal  Energy 
Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) was developed for Indian temperature conditions in 2015 by studying ISO 
standards and through consultations with manufacturers (Mukherjee et al. 2020).  

These measures had multiple effects on technological change. As a result of stringent standards, India 
has  some  of  the  most  efficient  refrigerators  globally.  In  the  case  of  ACs,  the  ISEER  accelerated 
technological change by favouring inverter-based ACs over fixed-speed ACs, driving down their costs 
and increasing their market shares (BEE 2020). 

Scaling up policies for market transformation 

As the S&L program was expanded, BEE took measures to standardise, codify and automate it. For 
example, to process a high volume of applications for labels efficiently, an online application portal 
with  objective  and  transparent  certification  criteria  was  created.  This  gave  certainty  to  the 
manufacturers, enabling diversity and faster diffusion of energy-efficient appliances. Thus by 2019, the 
program expanded to cover thousands of products across 23 appliance types (BEE 2020).

Besides  issuing  labels,  the  enforcement  of  standards  also  needed  to  be  scaled  up  efficiently.  BEE 
developed protocols for randomly sampling appliances for testing. Manufacturers were given a fixed 
period to rectify products that did not meet the standards, failing which they would be penalised and 
the test results would be made public.

16.3.3  Indicators for technological innovation  

Assessing the state of technological innovation helps understanding how current efforts and policies are 
doing in relation to stated objectives and how we might design policies in order to do better. 

Traditionally,  input  measures  such  as  RD&D  investments  and  output  measures  such  as  scientific 
publication and patents were used to characterise innovation activities (Freeman and Soete 2009), partly 
because of the successes of specialised R&D efforts (Freeman 1995a), the predominant linear model of 
innovation, and because such measures can (relatively) easily obtained and compared. In the realm of 
energy-related innovation, RD&D investments remains the single most-used indicator to measure inputs 
into the innovation process (Box 16.3). Patents counts are a widely used indicator of the outputs of the 
innovation  process,  especially  because  they  are  detailed  enough  to  provide  information  on  specific 
adaptation  and  mitigation  technologies.  Mitigation  and  adaptation  technologies  have  their  own 
classification  (Y02)  with  the  European  Patent  Office  (EPO)  (Veefkind  et  al.  2012;  Angelucci  et  al. 
2018), which can be complemented with keyword search and manual inspection (Persoon et al. 2020; 
Surana  et  al.  2020b).  However,  using  energy-related  patents  as  indicator  of  innovative  activities  is 
complicated  by  several  issues  (Haščič  and  Migotto  2015;  Jaffe  and  de  Rassenfosse  2017;  de 
Rassenfosse et al. 2013), including the fact that the scope of what are to be considered climate mitigation 
inventions is not always clear or straightforward. 

Conversely, private energy R&D investments and investments by financing firms cannot be precisely 
assessed for a number of reasons, including limited reporting and the difficulty of singling out energy-
related investments. This inability to precisely quantify private investments in energy R&D leads to a 
patchy  understanding  of  the  energy  innovation  system,  and  how  private  energy  R&D  investments 
responds to public energy R&D investments. Overall, evidence shows that some of the industrial sectors 
that are important for meeting climate goals (electricity, agriculture and forestry, mining, oil and gas, 
and other energy-intensive industrial sectors) are investing relatively small fractions of sales on R&D 
(medium  evidence,  high  agreement)  (European  Commission  2015;  National  Science  Board  2018; 
American Energy Innovation Council 2017; Jasmab and Pollitt 2005; Sanyal and Cohen 2009; Jamasb 
and Pollitt 2008; Gaddy et al. 2017).  

Financing firms also play an important role in the energy innovation process, but data availability is 
also limited. The venture capital (VC) financing model, used to overcome the “valley of death” in the 
biotech and IT space (Frank et al. 1996), has not been as suitable for hardware start-ups in the energy 
space: for example, the percentage of exit outcomes in clean-tech start-ups was almost half of that in 
medical start-ups and less than a third of software investments  (Gaddy et al. 2017). The current VC 
model and other private finance do not sufficiently cover the need to demonstrate energy technologies 
at scale  (Mazzucato 2013; Anadón 2012; Nemet et al. 2018). This greater difficulty in reaching the 
market compared to other sectors may have contributed to a reduction in private equity and venture 
capital finance for renewable energy technologies after the boom of the late 2000s (Frankfurt School-
UNEP Centre/BNEF 2019).

Public energy R&D investments are a crucial driver of energy technology innovation (Sections 16.2.1.1, 
16.4.1). Box 16.3, Figure 1 shows the time profile of energy-related RD&D budgets in OECD countries 
as well as some key events which coincided with developments of spending (IEA 2019). Such data on 
other countries, in particular developing countries, are not available, although recent evidence suggests 
that expenditures are increasing there (IEA 2020c). The IEA collected partial data from China and India 
in the context of Mission Innovation, but this is available only starting in 2014 and thus not included in 
the Figure.  

The figure illustrates two points. First, energy-related RD&D has risen slowly in the last 20 years, and 
is now reaching levels comparable with the peak of energy RD&D investments following the two oil 
crises. Second, over time there has been a reorientation of the portfolio of funded energy technologies 
away from nuclear energy. In 2019, around 80% of all public energy RD&D spending was on low-
emission technologies – energy efficiency, CCUS, renewables, nuclear, hydrogen, energy storage and 
cross-cutting  issues  such  as  smart  grids.  A  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  time  profile  of  RD&D 
spending in IEA countries, including as a share of GDP, are available in (IEA 2020b).

Quantitative indicators such as energy-related RD&D spending are insufficient for the assessment of 
innovation systems (David and Foray 1995): they only provide a partial view into innovation activities, 
and one that is potentially misleading (Freeman and Soete 2009). Qualitative indicators measuring the 
more  intangible  aspects  of  the  innovation  process  and  system  are  crucial  to  fully  understand  the 
innovation dynamics in a climate or energy technologies or sectors (Gallagher et al. 2006), including in 
relation  to  adopting  an  adaptive  learning  strategy  and  supporting  learning  through  demonstration 
projects (Chan et al. 2017).  

In Table 16.7, both quantitative and qualitative indicators for systemic innovation are outlined, using 
clean energy innovation as an illustrative example and drawing on a broad literature base, taking into 
account both the input-output-outcome classification and its variations (Hu et al. 2018; Freeman and 
Soete 1997; Sagar and Holdren 2002), combined with the functions of technological innovation systems

(Miremadi et al. 2018), while also being cognizant of the specific role of key actors and institutions 
(Gallagher  et  al.  2012).  A  specific  assessment  of  innovation  may  focus  on  part  of  such  a  list  of 
indicators, depending on what aspect of innovation is being studied, whether the analysis takes a more 
or  less  systemic  perspective,  and  the  specific  technology  and  geography  considered.  Similarly, 
innovation  policies  may  be  designed  to  specifically  boost  only  some  of  these  aspects,  depending 
whether a given country/region is committed to strengthen a given technology or phase.  

The systemic approach to innovation and transition dynamics (see also Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this 
chapter) has advanced our understanding of the complexity of the innovation process, pointing to the 
importance  of  assessing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  producing,  diffusing  and  exploiting 
knowledge (Lundvall 1992), including how the existing stock of knowledge may be recombined and 
used for new applications (David and Foray 1995). There remains a crucial need for more relevant and 
comprehensive approaches of assessing innovation (Freeman and Soete 2009; Dziallas and Blind 2019). 
In the context of climate mitigation, innovation is a means to an end; therefore, there is the need to 
consider the processes by which the output of innovation (e.g., patents) are translated into real-world 
outcomes (e.g., deployment of low-carbon technologies) (Freeman and Soete 1997; Sagar and Holdren 
2002). Currently, a set of quantitative metrics that, collectively, can help get a picture of innovation in 
a particular energy technology or set of energy technologies is not available. Also the understanding of 
how to systematically use qualitative indicators to characterise the more intangible aspects of the energy 
innovation system and to improve front-end innovation decisions is still lacking (Dziallas and Blind 
2019).

16.3.4  Emerging policy perspectives on systemic transformations 

Because of the multiple market, government, system, and other failures that are associated with the 
energy  system,  a  range  of  policy  interventions  are  usually  required  to  enable  the  development  and 
introduction  of  new  technologies  in  the  market  (Twomey  2012;  Jaffe  et  al.  2005;  Bürer  and 
Wüstenhagen 2009; Veugelers 2012; Negro et al. 2012; Weber and Rohracher 2012) and used in what 
is termed as policy mixes (Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Rogge et al. 2020; Edmondson et al. 2020, 2019) 
.  Empirical  research  shows  that  when  in  the  energy  and  environment  space  new  technologies  were 
developed and introduced in the market, it was usually at least partly as a result of a range of policies 
that shaped the socio-technical system (Nemet 2019a; Bunn et al. 2014; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; 
Bergek et al. 2015) (robust evidence, high agreement). An example of this systemic and dynamic nature 
of policies is the 70-year innovation journey of solar PV, covering multiple countries, which is reviewed 
in Box 16.4. 

START BOX 16.4 HERE 

Box 16.4 Sources of cost reductions in solar photovoltaics 

No  single  country  persisted  in  developing  solar  PV.  Five  countries  each  made  a  distinct 
contribution. Each leader relinquished its lead. The free flow of ideas, people, machines, finance, 
and  products  across  countries  explains  the  success  of  solar  photovoltaics  (PV).  Barriers  to 
knowledge flow delay innovation. 

Solar PV has attracted interest for decades, and until recently was seen as an intriguing novelty, serving 
a niche, but widely dismissed as a serious answer to climate change and other social problems associated 
with  energy  use.  Since  AR5,  PV  has  become  a  substantial  global  industry—a  truly  disruptive 
technology  that  has  generated  trade  disputes  among  superpowers,  threatened  the  solvency  of  large 
energy companies, and prompted reconsideration of electric utility regulation rooted in the 1930s. More 
favourably, its continually falling costs and rapid adoption are improving air quality and facilitating 
climate change mitigation. PV is now so inexpensive that it is important in an expanding set of countries. 
In 2020, 41 countries, in 6 continents, had installed at least 1GW of solar each (IRENA 2020a). 

The cost of generating electricity from solar PV is now lower in sunny locations than running existing 
fossil  fuel  power  plants  (Chapter  6)  (IEA  2020c).  Prices  in  2020  were  below  where  even  the  most 
optimistic experts expected they would be in 2030.  

The  costs  of  solar  PV  modules  have  fallen  by  more  than  a  factor  of  10,000  since  they  were  first 
commercialised  in  1957.  This  four  orders  of  magnitude  cost  reduction  from  the  first  commercial 
application  in  1958  until  2018  can  be summarised as  the result  of  distinct  contributions  by the  US, 
Japan, Germany, Australia, and China—in that sequence (Green 2019; Nemet 2019c). As shown in Box 
16.4 Figure 1, PV improved as the result of: 

1)  Scientific  contributions  in  the  1800s  and  early  1900s,  in  Europe  and  the  US,  that  provided  a 
fundamental understanding of the ways that light interacts with molecular structures, leading to the 
development of the p-n junction to separate electrons and holes (Einstein 1905; Ohl 1941);  

2)  A breakthrough at a corporate laboratory in the US in 1954 that made a commercially available PV 
device available and led to the first substantial orders, by the US Navy in 1957 (Gertner 2013; Ohl 
1946);  

3)  A government R&D and public procurement effort in the 1970s in the US, that entrained skilled 
scientists and engineers into the effort and stimulated the first commercial production lines (Laird 
2001; Christensen 1985; Blieden 1999);

4)  Japanese electronic conglomerates, with experience in semiconductors, serving niche markets in the 
1980s and in 1994 launching the world’s first major rooftop subsidy program, with a declining rebate 
schedule and demonstrating there was substantial consumer demand for PV (Kimura and Suzuki 
2006);  

5)  Germany passing a feed-in tariff in 2000 that quadrupled the market for PV catalysing development 
of  PV-specific  production equipment that automated and  scaled  PV manufacturing  (RESA 2001; 
Lauber and Jacobsson 2016);  

6)  Chinese  entrepreneurs,  almost  all  trained  in  Australia  and  using  Australian-invented  passivated 
emitter rear cell technology, building supply chains and factories of gigawatt scale in the 2000s. 
China became the world’s leading installer of PV from 2013 onward (Helveston and Nahm 2019; 
Quitzow 2015). 

7)  A  cohort  of  adopters  with  high  willingness  to  pay,  accessing  information  from  neighbours,  and 
installer firms that learned from their installation experience, as well as that of their competitors to 
lower soft costs (Gillingham et al. 2016; Ardani and Margolis 2015). 

Box 16.4, Figure 1 Milestones in the development of low-cost solar photovoltaics (Nemet 2019c) 

As this evolution makes clear, no individual country persisted in leading the technology and every world 
leading firm lost its lead within a few years (Green 2019). Solar followed an overlapping but sequential 
process of technology creation, market creation and cost reductions (comparable to emergence, early 
adoption, diffusion and stabilisation in Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter). In the technology creation 
phase examples of central processes include flows of knowledge from one person to another, between 
firms, and between countries as well as US and Japanese R&D funding in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
During market creation, PVs modular scale allowed it to serve a variety of niche markets from satellites 
in the 1950s to toys in the 1980s, when Germany transformed the industry from niche to mass market 
with  its  subsidy  program  that  began  in  2000  and  became  important  for  PV  in  2004.  The  dramatic 
increase in size combined with its 20-year guaranteed contracts reduced risk for investors and created 
confidence in PVs long term growth. Supportive policies also emerged outside Germany, in Spain, Italy, 
California, and China, which spread the risk even as national policy support was more volatile. Rapid 
and  deep  cost  reductions  were  made  possible  by  learning-by-doing  in  the  process  of  operating, 
optimising, and combining production equipment; investing and improving each manufacturing line to 
gradually scale up to massive sizes and incremental improvements in the PV devices themselves. 

Central to PV development has been its modularity, which provided two distinct advantages: access to 
niche markets, and iterative improvement. Solar has been deployed as a commercial technology across 
9 orders of magnitude: from a 1W cell in a calculator to a 1GW plant in the Egyptian desert, and almost 
every scale in between. This modular scale enabled PV to serve a sequence of policy-independent niche 
markets (such as satellites and telecom applications), which generally increased in size and decreased

in willingness to pay, in line with the technology cost reductions. This modular scale also enabled a 
large  number  of  iterations,  such  that  in  2020  over  three  billion  solar  panels  have  been  produced. 
Compared to, for instance, approximately 1000 nuclear reactors that were ever constructed, a million 
times  more  opportunities  for  learning-by-doing  were  available  to  solar  PV:  to  make  incremental 
improvements, to introduce new manufacturing equipment, to optimise that equipment, and to learn 
from  failures.  More  generally,  recent  work  has  point  to  the  benefits  of  modularity  in  the  speed  of 
adoption (Wilson et al. 2020) and learning rates (Sweerts et al. 2020).  

While many technologies do not fit into the solar model, some, including micro nuclear reactors and 
direct air capture, also have modular characteristics that make them suitable for following solar’s path 
and benefit from solar’s drivers. However, PV took solar 60 years to become cheap, which is too slow 
for addressing climate change if a technology is now still at the lab scale. A challenge in learning from 
the solar model is therefore to how to use public policy to speed up innovation over much shorter time 
frames, e.g. 15 or less years. 

END BOX 16.4 HERE 

There  are  many  definitions  of  policy  mixes from  various  disciplines  (Rogge  et al.  2017),  including 
environmental  economics  (Lehmann  2012),  policy  studies  (Kern  and  Howlett  2009)  and  innovation 
studies. Generally speaking, a policy mix can be characterised by a combination of building blocks, 
namely  elements,  processes  and  characteristics,  which  can  be  specified  using  different  dimensions 
(Rogge and Reichardt 2016). Elements include (i) the policy strategy with its objectives and principal 
plans and (ii) the mix of policy instruments, and (iii) instrument design. The content of these elements 
is the result of policy processes. Both elements and processes can be described by their characteristics 
in  terms  of  the  consistency  of  the  elements,  the  coherence  of  the  processes,  and  the  credibility  and 
comprehensiveness of the policy mix in different policy, governance, geography and temporal context 
(Rogge  and  Reichardt  2016).  Other  aspects  in  the  evaluation  of  policy  mixes  include  framework 
conditions,  the  type  of  policy  instrument  and  the  lower  level  of  policy  granularity,  namely  design 
elements or design features (del Río 2014; del Río and Cerdá 2017). In addition, many have argued the 
need  to  craft  policies  that  affect  different  actors  in  the  transition,  some  supporting  and  some 
‘destabilising’ (see e.g. Kivimaa and Kern (2016) and Geels (2002)). 

Learning from the innovation systems literature, some of the recent policy focus is not only directed on 
innovation policies that can optimise the innovation system to improve economic competitiveness and 
growth but also policies that can induce strategic directionality and guide processes of transformative 
changes towards desired societal objectives  (Mitcham 2003; Steneck 2006). Therefore, the aim is to 
connect  innovation  policy  with  societal  challenges  and  transformative  changes  through  engagement 
with a variety of actors and ideas and incorporating equity, nowadays often referred to as a just transition  
(Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Swilling et al. 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Jasanoff 2018) (see 
Chapter 1 and Chapter 17). This new policy paradigm is opening up a new discursive space, shapes 
policy outcomes, and is giving rise to the emerging idea of transformative innovation policy (Diercks 
et al. 2019; Fagerberg 2018).  

Transformative innovation policy has a broader coverage of the innovation process with a much wider 
participation  of  actors,  activities  and  modes  of  innovation.  It  is  often  expressed  as  socio-technical 
transitions (Elzen et al. 2004; Turnheim and Sovacool 2020) or societal transformations (Scoones 2015; 
Roberts et al. 2018). Transformative innovation policy encompasses different ideas and concepts that 
aim to address the societal challenges involving a variety of discussions including social innovation 
(Mulgan 2012), complex adaptive systems (Gunderson and Holling 2002), eco-innovation (Kemp 2011) 
and framework for responsible innovation (Stilgoe et al. 2013), value-sensitive design (Friedman and 
Hendry 2019) and social-technical integration (Fisher et al. 2006).

Building on the frameworks for identifying market failures (Section 16.2) and systemic failures (Section 
16.3) in the innovation system for climate-related technologies, Section 16.4 proceeds as follows. First, 
it considers some of the policy instruments introduced in Chapter 13 that are particularly relevant for 
the  pace  and  direction  of  innovation  in  technologies  for  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation. 
Second,  it explains  why  governments  put in  place  policies to  promote  innovation  in  climate  related 
technologies.  Third,  it  takes  stock  of  the  overall  empirical  and  theoretical  evidence  regarding  the 
relationship between policy instruments with a direct and an indirect impact on innovation outcomes 
(including intellectual property regimes) and also other outcomes (competitiveness and distributional 
outcomes). Fourth, it assesses the evidence on the impact of trade-related policies and of sub-national 
policies aiming to develop cleantech industrial clusters. 

This section focuses on innovation policies and institutions which are implemented at the national level. 
Whenever relevant, this section highlights examples of policies or initiatives that delve more deeply 
into the main high-level sectors: power, transport, industry, buildings, and AFOLU. Whenever possible, 
this  section  also  discusses  issues  in  policy  selection,  design,  and  implementation  that  have  been 
identified as more relevant in developing countries and emerging economies.  

Overall, this section shows that national and subnational policies and institutions are one of the main 
factors  determining  the  redirection  and  acceleration  of  technological  innovation  and  low-emission 
technological change (Åhman et al. 2017; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Anadon et al. 2016b; Anadón et 
al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement). Both technology push (e.g., scientific 
training, R&D) and demand pull (e.g., economic and fiscal support and regulatory policy instruments), 
as well as instruments promoting knowledge flows and especially  research-firm technology transfer, 
can be part of the mix (robust evidence, medium agreement) (see also Sections 16.2 and 16.3).  

Public  R&D  investments  in  energy  and  climate-related  technologies  have  a  positive  impact  on 
innovation outcomes (medium evidence, high agreement). The evidence on procurement is generally 
positive  but  limited.  The  record  economic  policy  instruments  that  can  be  classified  as  market  pull 
instruments when it comes to the competitiveness outcome (at least in the short term) is more mixed. 
The review of the literature in this section shows that market pull policy instruments had positive but 
also some negative impacts on outcomes in some instances on some aspects of competitiveness and 
distributional outcomes (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Peñasco et al. 2021). For several of 
them, carbon taxes or feed-in tariffs for example, the evidence of a positive impact on innovation is 
more consistent than the others. Evidence suggests that complementary policies or improved policy 
design can mitigate such short-term negative distributional impacts. 

16.4.1  Overview of policy instruments for climate technology innovation  

Government  policies  can influence  changes  in technologies, as  well  as changes  to the  systems they 
support (Somanathan et al. 2014) (see Chapter 13 and Sections 16.2 and 16.3).    

Technology-push policy instruments stimulate innovation by increasing the supply of new knowledge 
through  funding  and  performing  research;  increasing  the  supply  of  trained  scientists  and  engineers 
which contribute to knowledge-generation and provide technological opportunities, which private firms 
can decide to commercialise (Mowery and Rosenberg 1979; Anadon and Holdren 2009; Nemet 2009b; 
Mazzucato 2013).  

Governments  can  also  stimulate  technological  change  through  demand-pull  (or:  market-pull) 
instruments which support market creation or expansion and technology transfer and thus promoting 
learning by doing, economies of scale, and automation (Section 16.2). Demand-pull policy instruments

include regulation, carbon prices, subsidies that reduce the cost of adoption, public procurement, and 
intellectual  property  regulation.  Typically,  technology  push  is  especially  important  for  early-stage 
technologies, characterised by higher uncertainty and lower appropriability (see Section 16.2); demand-
pull  instruments  become  more  relevant  in  the  later  stages  of  the  innovation  process  (Section  16.2) 
(Mowery and Rosenberg 1979; Anadon and Holdren 2009; Nemet 2009b). 

The second column of Table 16.8 summarises the set of policies shaping broader climate outcomes over 
the past few decades in many countries outlined in Chapter 13 Section 13.6, which groups them into 
economic and financial, regulatory, and soft instruments. Other policies, such as monetary, banking and 
trade policies, for instance, can also shape innovation but most government action to shape energy has 
not  focussed  on them.  As Table  16.8  shows, this  section  discusses  the  set  of  policy  instruments  on 
innovation outcomes, or a subset of the ‘Transformative Potential’ criterion presented in Chapter 13, 
and thus complements the more general discussion presented there. Table 16.8 specifically prioritizes 
the  impact of the subset of policy instruments on innovation outcomes for which evidence is available. 
This  focus  is  complemented  by  a  discussion  of  the  impact  of  the  same  policy  instruments  on 
competitiveness  (a  subcomponent  of  the  economic  effectiveness  evaluation  criterion)  and  on 
distributional  outcomes.  Many  of  the  policy  instrument  types  listed  in  Table  16.8  have  been 
implemented  or  proposed  to  address  different  types  of  market  or  systemic  failures  or  bottlenecks 
described in Section 16.2 and Section 16.3 (OECD 2011a).

Section  16.3  characterized  technological  innovation  as  a  systemic,  non-linear  and  dynamic  process. 
Figure  16.1  below  presents  a  stylized  (and  necessarily  incomplete  view)  connecting  the  innovation 
process stages presented in Section 16.2, some of the key  the mechanisms in technology innovation 
systems, and  some of the decarbonisation policy instruments that have been assessed in terms of their 
impact on technological innovation outcomes in Section 16.4.4. As noted in the caption and discussed 
in Section16.4.4, regulatory policy instruments also shape the early stages of technology development. 

Figure 16.1 Technology innovation process and the (illustrative) and role of different public 
policy instruments (on the right-hand side). Adapted from IEA (IEA 2020a). Note that, as 
shown in section 16.4.4, demand pull instruments in the regulatory instrument category, for 
instance, can also shape the early stages of the innovation process. Their position on the latter 
stages is highlighted in this figure just because typically these instruments have been introduced 
in latter stages of the development of the technology. 

16.4.2  The  drivers  and  politics  of  national  policies  for  climate  change  mitigation  and 

adaptation  

Governments around the world implement innovation policies in the energy and climate space with the 
aim of simultaneously advancing environmental, industrial policy (or competitiveness), and security 
goals  (Surana  and  Anadon  2015;  Meckling  et  al.  2017;  Matsuo  and  Schmidt  2019;  Anadón  2012; 
Peñasco  et  al.  2021)  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Co-benefits  of  policies  shaping 
technological  innovation  in  climate-related  technologies,  including  competitiveness,  health,  and 
improved distributional impacts can be drivers of climate mitigation policy in the innovation sphere

(Deng et al. 2018a; Stokes and Warshaw 2017; Probst et al. 2020). This was the case for climate and 
air pollution policies with local content requirements for different types of renewable energy projects, 
for instance. in  places including  China  (Lewis  2014; Qiu  and  Anadon 2012),  India  (Behuria  2020), 
South  Africa  (Kuntze  and Moerenhout  2012),  and  Canada  (Genest  2014) (robust  evidence,  medium 
agreement).  

The  emergence  of  industries  and  support  groups  can  lead  to  more  sustained  support  for  innovation 
policies  (Schmid  et  al.  2020;  Stokes  and  Breetz  2018;  Meckling  2019;  Meckling  and  Nahm  2019; 
Meckling  et  al.  2015a;  Schmidt  and  Sewerin  2017a).  Conversely,  policies  shaping  technology 
innovation contribute to the creation and evolution of different stakeholder groups  (robust evidence, 
high agreement). Most of the literature on the role of the politics and interest groups has focused on 
renewable energy technologies although there is some work on heating in buildings (e.g. Wesche et al. 
2019).  

As novel technologies become cost-competitive, opposition of incumbents usually grows, as well as the 
dangers  of  lock-in  that  can  be  posed  by  the  new  winner.  Addressing  this  involves  adapting  policy 
(robust evidence, high agreement).  

Three phases of politics in the development of policies to meet climate and industrial objectives can be 
identified, at the top, the middle and the bottom of the experience curve (Breetz et al. 2018) (see also 
Figure 16.1 above, and Geels (2002)). In the first phase of ‘niche market diffusion’, the politics of more 
sustained support for a technology or set of technologies become possible after a group of economic 
winners and ‘clean energy constituencies’ are created (Meckling et al. 2015a). When technologies grow 
out of the niche (second phase), they pose a more serious competition to incumbents who may become 
more vocal opponents of additional support for innovation in the competing technologies (Stokes 2016; 
Geels 2014a). In a third phase, path-dependence in policymaking and lock-in in institutions need to 
change  to  accommodate  new  infrastructure,  the  integration  of  technologies,  the  emergence  of 
complementary technologies and of new regulatory regimes (Aklin and Urpelainen 2013; Levin et al. 
2012).  

16.4.3  Indicators to assess the innovation, competitiveness and distributional outcomes 

of policy instruments 

If policy instruments are created to (at least partly) shape innovation for systemic transitions to a zero-
carbon future, they also need to be evaluated on their impact on the whole socio-technical system (Neij 
and Åstrand 2006) and a wide range of goals, including distributional impacts and competitiveness and 
jobs (Stern 2007; Peñasco et al. 2021). Given this and the current policy focus on green recovery and 
green industrial policy, although we primarily focus on innovation outcomes, we assess also impacts 
on competitiveness and equity. Table 16.9 lists the selected set of indicators used to assess the impact 
of the  policy  instrument types covered  in  right  hand side  column in  Table  16.8.  The table  does  not 
include technology diffusion or deployment because these are covered in the technological effectiveness 
evaluation  criterion  in  Chapter  13.  As  noted  in  section  16.2,  it  is  very  difficult  to  measure  or  fully 
understand innovation with one or even several indicators. In addition, all indicators have strengths and 
weaknesses  and  may  be  more  relevant  in  some  countries  and  sectors  than  in  others.  The  literature 
assessing the impact of different policy instruments on innovation often covers just one of the various 
indicators listed in the second column of Table 16.9.

16.4.4  Assessment of innovation and other impacts of innovation policy instruments  

While  it  is  very  difficult  to  attribute  a  causal  relationship  between  a  particular  policy  instrument 
implementation and different innovation indicators, given the complexity of the innovation system (see 
Section 16.3) there is a large quantitative and qualitative literature aiming to identify such impact. 

16.4.4.1  Assessment  of  the  impact  on  innovation  of  technology  push  policy  instruments:  public 

RD&D investments, other R&D incentives and public procurement 

Economic and direct investment policy instrument types are typically associated with a direct focus on 
technological  innovation:  R&D  grants,  R&D  tax  credits,  prizes,  national  laboratories,  technology 
incubators (including support for business development, plans), novel direct funding instruments (e.g., 
ARPA-E), and innovation procurement.  

Public RD&D investments have been found to have a positive impact on different innovation in energy 
and climate related technologies (robust evidence, high agreement), but the assessment relies almost 
entirely on evidence from industrialised countries. Out of 17 publications focussing on this assessment, 
only three found no relationship between R&D funding and innovation metrics (Peñasco et al. 2021; 
Goldstein et al. 2020; Doblinger et al. 2019). Sixteen out of them used ex post quantitative methods and 
one  relied  on  theoretical  ex  ante  assessment;  only  two  of  them  included  some  non-industrialised 
countries, with one being the theoretical analysis. The evidence available does not point to public R&D 
funding for climate-related technologies crowding out private R&D (an important driver of innovation) 
but instead crowding it in. Box 16.6 summarizes the evidence available of the impact of ARPA-E (a 
public institution created in the United States in 2009 to allocate public R&D funding in energy) on 
innovation  and  competitiveness  outcomes.  Another  institution  supporting  energy  R&D  that  is  the 
subject of much interest is the Fraunhofer Institute.  

No  evidence  regarding  the  specific  impact  of  R&D  tax  credits  on  climate  mitigation  or  adaptation 
technologies has been found, but it is worth noting that generally speaking, R&D tax credits are found 
to incentivize innovation in firms in general, with an greater impact on small and medium firms (OECD 
2020). This is consistent with the fact that most of the evidence on the positive impact of public R&D 
support schemes covers small and medium firms (Howell 2017; Doblinger et al. 2019; Goldstein et al. 
2020).  Although  there  is  a  high  level  of  agreement  in  the  literature  regarding  the  impact  of  R&D

investments on innovation outcomes in climate-related technologies, it is important to note that this 
evidence  comes  from  industrialised  countries.  This  does  not  mean  that  public  R&D  investments  in 
energy  have  been  found  to  have  no  impact  on  developing  countries  innovation  or  competitiveness 
outcomes, but rather that we were not able to find such studies focussing on developing countries. 

Overall, public procurement has high potential to incentivise innovation in climate technologies, but 
the  evidence  is  mixed,  particularly  in  developing  countries  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement). 
Public procurement accounted for 13 % of gross domestic products in OECD in 2013 and much more 
in  some  emerging  and  developing  economies  (Baron  2016).  Its main  goal is  to acquire  products  or 
services to improve public services, infrastructures and facilities and, in some cases, to also incentivize 
innovation. It is important to implement several steps in the public procurement procedure to improve 
transparency,  minimise  waste,  fraud  and  corruption  of  public  fund.  These  steps  range  from  the 
assessment of a need, issuance of a tender to the monitoring of delivery of the good or service. Box 16.5 
outlines a public procurement program that was implemented in The Netherlands in 2005 with a focus 
on green technologies. In spite of the fact that green procurement policies have been implemented, the 
literature  assessing the innovation impact of public procurement programs is relatively limited and 
suggests either a positive impact or no impact (Peñasco et al. 2021; Alvarez and Rubio 2015; Fernández-
Sastre and Montalvo-Quizhpi 2019; Baron 2016). The majority of cases where the impact is positive 
are analyses of industrialised countries, while no impact emerges in the case of a developing country 
(Ecuador). More empirical research is needed to understand the impact of public procurement, which 
has the potential to support the achievement of other societal challenges (Edler and Georghiou 2007; 
Henderson and Newell 2011; ICLEI 2018; Baron 2016) in both developing and developed countries.

Box 16.5 Green Public Procurement in The Netherlands 

In 2005, the Dutch national government acknowledged a move in the House of Representatives to utilise 
their annual spending power to promote the market for sustainable goods and services as well as to play 
as  a  role  model.  Hence,  a  policy  for  environmentally  friendly  procurement  was  developed  and 
implemented across the national, local and provincial governments. Subsequently, sustainable public 
procurement has expanded into a multidimensional policy in the Netherlands, accommodating policies 
on green public procurement, bio-based public procurement, international social criteria, social return 
on investment, innovation-oriented public procurement and circular economy.  

The  Green  Public  Procurement  (GPP)  policy  is  targeted  at  minimising  the  negative  impacts  of 
production and consumption  on the  nature  environment  (Melissen  and  Reinders 2012;  Cerutti et  al. 
2016).  It  includes  a  wide  range  of  environmental  criteria  for  different  product  groups  that  public 
organisations frequently procure such as office equipment, uniforms, road works and catering. There 
are 45 product groups (Melissen and Reinders, 2012) and 6 product clusters part of the government’s 
purchasing in terms of sustainability(PIANOo Expertisecentrum 2020). The six product clusters are: i) 
Automation & telecommunications, ii) Energy, iii) Ground, road & hydraulic engineering, iv) Office 
facilities and services, v) Office buildings, and vi) Transport  (PIANOo Expertisecentrum 2020).The 
GPP 2020 Tender Implementation Plan spells out the terms and conditions for making their green public 
procurement. Some of these are confidential documents and are not shared online. Others are available 
for  download.  The 
is  available  on 
https://gpp2020.eu/low-carbon-tenders/open-tenders/. One of the important scenarios is that the public 
procurers need the details of LCA analysis carried out in a tool called DuboCalc which calculates the 
environmental  impacts  of  the  materials  and  methods  of  an  infrastructural  projects.  GPP  2020  has 
reported that three million tonnes of CO2 would be saved in the Netherlands alone if all Dutch public 
authorities applied the national Sustainable Public Procurement Criteria.

Research  has  been  carried  out  to  determine  the  prime  mover  for  implementing  Green  Public 
Procurement. An online survey of was administered among public procurement officers that subscribed 
to  the  newsletters  of  two  Dutch  associations  that  provide  advice  and  training  to  public  procurers, 
yielding a sample size of over 200  (Grandia and Voncken 2019). The first association is called NEVI 
which is the only organisation in the Netherlands that offers certified procurement training programmes. 
The second association is called PIANOo which is a public procurement expertise centre paid by the 
Dutch national government for bringing together relevant information regarding public procurement 
and  providing  public  procurers  with  useful  tools  through  their  websites,  workshops,  meetings  and 
annual conferences. The data from the survey was then analysed using structural equations modelling 
(SEM) and the results show that ability, motivation and opportunities affect the implementation of GPP. 
Particularly,  opportunity  was  found  to  affect  green  public  procurement,  innovation-oriented  public 
procurement and circular economy but not the other types of public procurement.

16.4.4.2  Assessment of the impact on competitiveness of technology push policy instruments: public 

RD&D investments, other R&D incentives and public procurement 

Public R&D investments in the energy, renewables, environment space are generally associated with 
positive  impacts  on  industrial  development  or  ‘competitiveness  outcome’ (robust  evidence,  medium 
agreement). In a number of cases negligible or negative impacts emerge (Peñasco et al. 2021; Goldstein 
et  al.  2020;  Doblinger  et  al.  2019).  The  majority  of  these  15  analyses  rely  on  ex  post  quantitative 
methods, while only four use ex ante modelling approaches. Also, in this case, the vast majority of the 
evidence is from industrialised countries.  

There is limited and mixed evidence regarding the (positive or negative) impact of public procurement 
for low-carbon or climate technologies and it emerges from developed countries (limited evidence, low 
agreement). All of the four evaluations identified in the Peñasco et al (2021) review relied on qualitative 
methods. One found a positive impact, another a negative impact and two others found no impact. All 
of the studies covered European country experiences.  

R&D and procurement policies have a positive impact on distributional outcomes (limited evidence, 
high agreement). Peñasco et al (2021) identify three evaluations of the impact of RD&D funding on 
distributional outcomes (two using quantitative methods and one ex ante theoretical methods) and one 
of procurement on distributional outcomes (relying on qualitative analysis).  

16.4.4.3  Emerging insights on different public R&D and demonstration funding schemes  

The ability of a given R&D policy instrument to impact innovation and competitiveness depends to 
some  extent  on  policy  design  features  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  As  discussed  in  section 
16.4.4.4,  this  is  not  unique  to  R&D  funding.  Most  of  these  assessments  use  a  limited  number  of 
indicators (e.g., patents and publications and follow-on private financing, firm growth and survival, 
respectively),  focusses  on  the  energy  sector  and  on  the  US  and  other  industrialised  countries. 
Extrapolating to emerging economies and low-income countries is difficult. There is no evidence on 
the impact of different ways of allocating public energy R&D investments in the context of developing 
countries.  

Block funding, which tends to be more flexible, can lead to research that is more productive or novel, 
but there are other factors that can affect the extent to which block funding can lead to more or less 
novel  outcomes  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Research  on  national  research  laboratories, 
which conduct at least 30% of all research in 68 countries around the world (Anadon et al. 2016a), are 
a  widespread  mechanism  to  carry  out  public  R&D  and  allocate  funds,  but  assessments  of  their 
performance  is  limited  to  developed  countries.  R&D  priorities  are  also  guided  by  institutions,  and

research focussed on general technology innovation policy finds that institutions often do not embody 
the goals of the poor or marginalized (Anadon et al. 2016b). 

In the case of the US Department of Energy, block funding that can be quickly allocated to novel l 
projects  (such  as  that  allocated  to  National  Labs  as  part  of  the  Laboratory  Directed  Research  and 
Development—LDRD—funding) has been found to be associated with improved innovation indicators 
(Anadon  et  al.  2016a).  Research  on  Japan  on  R&D  funding  in  general  (not  for  climate-related 
technologies) however, indicates that R&D funds allocated competitively result in higher novelty for 
‘high status’ (the term used in the paper to refer to senior male researchers), while block funding was 
associated with research of higher novelty for lower status researchers (e.g., junior female researchers) 
(Wang et al. 2018).  

START BOX 16.6 HERE 

Box 16.6 ARPA-E a novel R&D funding allocation mechanism focussed on an energy mission 

One approach for allocating public R&D funds in energy involves relying on active program managers 
and  having  clear  technology  development  missions  that  focus  on  high-risk  high-reward  areas  and 
projects. This approach can be exemplified by a relatively new energy R&D funding agency in the US, 
the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E). This agency was created in 2009 and 
it was modelled on the experience of DARPA (a US government agency funding high risk high reward 
research  in  defence-related  areas  (Bonvillian  and  Van  Atta  2011;  Bonvillian  2018;  U.S.  National 
Academies  of  Sciences  Engineering  and  Medicine  2017).  DARPA  program  managers  had  a  lot  of 
discretion for making decisions about funding projects, but since energy R&D funding is usually more 
politically  vulnerable  than  defence  R&D  funding,  the  ARPA-E  novel  involved  program  managers 
requesting external review as an informational input (Azoulay et al. 2019).  

Like  DARPA,  ARPA-E  program  managers  use  an  ‘active  management  approach  that  involves 
empowering  program  manages  to  make  decisions  about  funding  allocation,  milestones  and  goals. 
ARPA-E managers also differ from other R&D allocation mechanisms in that ARPA-E staff retained 
some control on the funded projects after the allocation of the funds. As argued by (Azoulay et al. 2019), 
even though this relative control over the project can result in a reduction in the flexibility of funded 
researchers, some ‘exploration’ happens at the program manager level. 

Research on ARPA-E also sheds light on how program managers make decisions about what projects 
to fund: about the process of project selection. Program managers do not just follow the rankings of 
peer  reviewers  (sometimes  projects  with  very  disparate  rankings  were  funded)  and  in  many  cases 
program managers reported using information from review comments instead of the rankings (Goldstein 
and  Kearney  2020).  Azoulay  et  al.  (2019)  suggest  that  if  expert  disagreement  is  a  useful  proxy  for 
uncertainty in research, then the use of individual discretion in ARPA-E would result in a portfolio of 
projects with a higher level of uncertainty, as defined by disagreement among reviewers. Moreover, 
under the premise that uncertainty is a corollary to novelty, individual discretion is an antidote to novelty 
bias in peer review.  

While innovation is notoriously hard to track and, particularly for emerging technologies, it can take a 
lot time to assess, early analysis has shown that this mission-orientation and more ‘actively managed’ 
R&D funding program may yield greater innovation patenting outcomes than other US energy R&D 
funding programs and a greater or similar rate of academic publications when compared to other public 
funding agencies in energy in the US, ranging from the Office of Science, the more applied Office of 
Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  or  the  small  grants  office  (Goldstein  and  Narayanamurti 
2018;  U.S.  National  Academies  of  Sciences  Engineering  and  Medicine  2017).  In  addition  research 
analysing the first cohort of cleantech start-ups has found that start-ups supported by ARPA-E had more

innovative outcomes when compared to those that had applied but not received funding, with others 
that  had  not  received  any  government  support,  and  with  others  that  had  received  other  types  of 
government R&D support (Goldstein et al. 2020). Overall, the mission-oriented ARPA approach has 
been successful  in the United States when it comes to innovation outcomes. The extent to which it can 
yield the same outcomes in other geographies with different innovation and financing environments  
remains unknown. (limited evidence, high agreement). 

END BOX 16.6 HERE 

Public financing for R&D and research collaboration in the energy sector is important for small firms, 
at  least  in  industrialised  countries,  and  it  does  not  seem  to  crowd  out  private  investment  in  R&D 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Small US and UK firms accrue more patents and financing when 
provided with cash incentives for R&D in the form of grants (Pless 2019; Howell 2017). US cleantech 
start-ups  which  partner  with  government  partners  for  joint  technology  development  or  licensing 
partnerships accrue more patents and follow on financing (Doblinger et al. 2019).  

Overall, the body of literature on public R&D funding design in energy and climate related technologies 
provides some  high-level guidance  on  how to make the most  of  these  direct  RD&D  investments  in 
energy technologies in the climate change mitigation space, including: giving researchers and technical 
experts autonomy and influence over funding decisions; incorporating technology transfer in research 
organisations; focussing demonstration projects on learning; incentivising international collaboration 
in energy research; adopting an adaptive learning strategy; and making funding stable and predictable 
(Narayanamurti and Odumosu 2016; Narayanamurti et al. 2009; Chan et al. 2017) (medium evidence, 
high agreement). 

Without carefully designed public funding for demonstration efforts, often in a cost shared manner with 
industry, the experimentation at larger scales needed for more novel technologies needed for climate 
change  mitigation  may  not  take  place.  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement).  Government  funding 
specifically  for  technology  demonstration  projects,  for  RD&D  (research,  development  and 
demonstration) in energy technologies plays a crucial supporting role (Section 16.2.1). Governments 
can facilitate knowledge spill-overs between firms, between countries, and between technologies (see 
Section 16.2, Cohen et al (2002) and Baudry and Bonnet (2019)).  

16.4.4.4  Assessment  of  the  impact  on  innovation  and  on  competitiveness  and  distributional 

outcomes of market pull policy instruments  

Demand pull policies such as tradeable green certificates, taxes, or auctions, are essential to support 
scaling up efforts (Remer and Mattos 2003; Nahm and Steinfeld 2014; Wilson 2012). Just like for R&D 
investments, research has indicated that effective demand pull needs to be credible, durable, and aligned 
with other policies (Nemet et al. 2017) and that the effectiveness of different demand pull instruments 
depends on policy design (del Río and Kiefer 2021). Historical analyses of the relative importance of 
demand pull and technology push are clear; both are needed to provide robust incentives for investment 
in innovation. Interactions between them are central as their combination enables innovators to connect 
a  technical  opportunity  with  a  market  opportunity  (Grubler  and  Wilson  2013;  Freeman  1995b; 
Jacobsson  et  al.  2004).  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  market  pull  policies  are  often  put  in  place 
primarily to meet security and/or environmental goals, although innovation and competitiveness are 
sometimes also pursued explicitly. 

Emission Trading Schemes 
Overall  evidence  suggests  that  the  emissions  trading  schemes,  as  currently  designed,  have  not 
significantly contributed to innovation outcomes (medium evidence, medium/high agreement).

Penasco et al. (2021) review 20 evaluations: eight identified a positive impact (although in at least two 
cases the paper indicated the impact was small or negligible), 11 no impact and one was associated with 
a negative impact on innovation indicators. The studies that found no impact and the studies that found 
some impact covered all three methods covered (quantitative ex post, qualitative and theoretical and ex 
ante  analysis).  Another  review  focussed  only  on  empirical  studies  (mainly  quantitative  but  also 
qualitative), covered a slightly longer period and identified 19 studies (15 using quantitative methods) 
(Lilliestam et al. 2021). With a narrower set of indicators of innovation, they concluded there was very 
little  empirical  evidence  linking  the  emissions  trading  schemes  studied  to  date  and  innovation 
(Lilliestam  et  al.  2021).  This  review  focussed  mainly  on  papers  evaluating  the  earlier  stages  of  the 
European Emissions Trading Scheme, which featured relatively low CO2 prices and covered a small set 
of firms, showing that carbon pricing policy design is an important determinant of innovation outcomes. 
Combining  both  reviews,  there  are  a  total  of  27  individual  studies,  some  of  them  providing  mixed 
evidence of impact, and 23 of them suggest there was no impact or (in a couple of cases) it was small. 
It is important to note that some researchers note that, for particular subsectors and actors, emissions 
trading schemes have had an impact on patenting trends (Calel and Dechezleprêtre 2016). Overall the 
expectation is that higher prices and coverage would result in higher impacts and that, over time, the 
impact on innovation would grow.   

Carbon and environmental taxes 
The impact of carbon taxes on innovation outcomes is more positive than that for ETS schemes but the 
evidence  is  more  limited  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Assessments  of  their  impact  on 
innovation metrics have been very limited, with only four studies (three quantitative and one ex ante). 
Three of the studies found a positive impact of carbon taxes on innovation outcomes and one found no 
impact (Peñasco et al. 2021).  

Depending on the design (including the value and coverage of the tax), carbon taxes can either have 
positive, negative or null impact on competitiveness and distributional outcomes (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). The evidence on the impact of carbon taxes on competitiveness is significant (a 
total of 27 evaluations) and mixed, with six of them reporting some positive impacts, ten reporting no 
impact, and 11 reporting negative impacts (so 59% were not associated with negative impacts). Most 
of  the  evaluations  reporting  negative  impacts  were  theoretical  assessments,  and  only  three  ex  post 
quantitative  analysis  (Peñasco  et  al.  2021).  24  evaluations  covered  distributional  impacts  of  carbon 
taxes  and  other  environmental  taxes  and  the  majority  (15)  found  the  existence  of  some    negative 
distributional impacts, six found positive impacts and three no distributional impacts. Differences in the 
result of the assessments stem from the design of the taxes (Peñasco et al. 2021). It is important to note 
that, once again, the evidence comes from industrialized countries and emerging economies. 

Feed-in-Tariffs 
Many factors affect the impacts of feed in tariffs on outcomes other than innovation (robust evidence, 
high agreement).  While FITs have been generally associated with positive innovation outcomes, some 
of the differences found in the literature may arise from differences in the evaluation method (Peñasco 
et  al.  2021)  or  differences  in  policy  design  (e.g.,  the  level  and  the  rate  of  decrease  of  the  tariff) 
(Hoppmann et al. 2014), the policy mixes (Rogge et al. 2017), the technologies targeted and their stage 
of development (Huenteler et al. 2016b), and the geographical and temporal context of where the policy 
was put in place (Section 16.3). Research has also found that, particularly for less mature technologies, 
a higher technology specificity in the design of FITs is associated with more innovation (Del Río 2012). 
Feed-in-tariffs yield better results if they account for the specificities of the country; else, the technology 
and the policy could result in negative distributional and (to a lesser extent) competitiveness impacts. 
Meckling et al (2017) indicate that an ‘enduring challenge’ of technology-specific industrial policy such 
as some feed-in-tariffs is to avoid locking in suboptimal clean technologies—a challenge which, among 
other options, could be overcome with targeted niche procurement for next generation technologies.

Other  authors  have  cautioned  that  the  move  from  renewable  feed-in-tariffs  to  auctions  may  favour 
existing PV (e.g., polysilicon) over more novel solar power technologies (Sivaram 2018b) such as thin-
film PV, amorphous PV, and perovskites.  

Policy design, policy mixes, and domestic capacity and infrastructure are important factors determining 
the extent to which economic policy instruments in industrialised countries and emerging economies 
can also lead to positive (or at least not negative) competitiveness outcomes and distributional outcomes 
(medium evidence, medium agreement) (Section 16.3). Prioritising low cost energy generation in the 
design of FIT schemes can result in a lower focus of innovation efforts on more novel technologies and 
greater barriers to incumbents in less mature technologies (Hoppmann et al. 2013). Similarly, case study 
research  from  Mexico  and  South  Africa  indicates  that  focusing  on  low-cost  renewable  energy 
generation only can result in a greater reliance on existing foreign value chains and capital, and thus in 
lower or negative impacts on domestic competitiveness—in other words, some approaches can hinder 
the development of the local capabilities that could result in greater long-term benefits domestically 
(Matsuo  and  Schmidt  2019).  Evidence  for  developing  countries  indicates  that  local  and  absorptive 
capacity  also  play  an  important  role  in  particular  on  the  ability  of  policies  to  contribute  to 
competitiveness or industrial policy goals (e.g., Binz and Anadon 2018). Research comparing China’s 
and India’s policies and outcomes on wind also suggest that policy durability and systemic approaches 
can affect industrial outcomes (Surana and Anadon 2015).  

Energy auctions 
The evidence of the impact of renewable energy auctions on innovation outcomes is very small and 
provides mixed results (limited evidence, low agreement). Out of six evaluations, three of them identify 
positive  impacts,  two  no  impacts,  and  one  negative  impacts.  All  of  the  evaluations  but  one  were 
qualitative  or theoretical and  the  quantitative  assessment  indicated  no  impact  (Peñasco  et  al.  2021). 
There  is  more  evidence  covering  emerging  economies  analysing  the  impacts  of  auctions  when 
compared to other policy instrument types. For example, there is work comparing the approaches to 
renewable energy auctions in South Africa and Denmark (Toke 2015) finding a positive impact on the 
latter  stages  of  innovation  (mainly  deployment),  and  broader  work  on  auctions  covering  OECD 
countries  as  well  as  Brazil,  South  Africa  and  China  not  finding  a  significant  impact  on  innovation 
(Wigand et al. 2016), and work comparing renewable energy auctions in different countries in South 
America finding generally a positive impact on innovation outcomes (Mastropietro et al. 2014). The 
body of evidence on the impact of auctions on competitiveness is also limited (six evaluations) and 
indicates  negative  outcomes  of  renewable  auctions  of  competitiveness  (limited  evidence,  low 
agreement). As with other policies, the design of the auctions can affect innovation outcomes (del Río 
and Kiefer 2021). Only two studies investigated distributional outcomes and both were negative. 

Other financial instruments 
There  is  no  explicit  literature  on  the  ability  of  green  public  banks,  and  targeted  loans,  and  loan 
guarantees to lead to upstream innovation investments and activities, although there is evidence on their 
role in deployment (see e.g. Geddes et al (2018)). This notwithstanding the key role of these institutions 
in the innovation system (Sections 16.2.1 and 16.3) (OECD 2015c; Geddes et al. 2018) and the belief 
that they can de-risk scale-up and the testing of business models (Probst et al. 2021; Geddes et al. 2018) 
(see Chapter 17).  

Renewable obligations with tradeable green certificates 
There is mixed evidence of the impact of tradeable green certificates (TGCs) on innovation (limited 
evidence,  low  agreement)  and  competitiveness  (limited  evidence,  low  agreement).  Out  of  the  11 
evaluations in Peñasco et al (2021), six found no impact, two a positive impact, and three a negative 
impact. All of them used a qualitative research approach. Of the six studies focusing on competitiveness 
outcomes, three conclude TGCs have had no impact on competitiveness, while two indicate negative

impact and one a positive impact. Only one of the studies was quantitative and did not identify an impact 
on competitiveness.  

TGC are associated with the existence of negative distributional impacts in most applications (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Ten out of 12 studies identify the existence of some negative impacts. All 
but one of these studies (which focussed on India) are based on analysis of policies implemented in 
industrialised countries. 

Clean Energy and renewable Portfolio Standards 
The  impact  of  renewable  portfolio  standards  without  tradeable  credits  on  innovation  outcomes  is 
negligible or very small (medium evidence, medium agreement). Out of the nine studies, seven reported 
no impact on innovation outcomes and two a positive impact (Peñasco et al. 2021). Most of these papers 
focussed  on  patenting  and  private  R&D  innovation  indicators  and  not  cost  reductions.  Impact  on 
competitiveness is  found  to  be  negligible  or  positive  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Out  of 
eight  evaluations,  five  report  positive impact  and  three  negligible  impact;  only two  are  quantitative 
studies (Peñasco et al. 2021). Negative distributional impacts from renewable portfolio standards can 
emerge  in  some  cases  (limited  evidence,  low  agreement).  Out  of  eight  evaluations,  four  identified 
positive  impacts,  and  four  negative  impacts;  all  of  the  studies  identifying  a  positive  impact  were 
theoretical. There are efforts focussed on clean energy portfolio standards which include technologies 
beyond renewables. 

Efficiency obligations with tradeable credits 
The impact of tradeable white certificates in innovation is largely positive, but the evidence is limited 
(limited  evidence,  medium/high  agreement).  Out  of  four  evaluations,  only  one  of  which  was 
quantitative, three report positive impact and one no impact (Peñasco et al. 2021). The impact of white 
certificates  on  competitiveness  is  positive  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement)  while  that  on 
distributional outcomes is very mixed (limited evidence, low agreement). Two theoretical studies report 
positive  competitiveness  impacts.  Out  of  11  evaluations  of  distributional  outcomes,  eight  rely  on 
theoretical  ex  ante  approaches.  Seven  evaluations  reported  positive  impacts  (four  of  them  using 
theoretical methods), three of them (using theoretical methods) indicated negative impacts and one of 
them no impact.  

Building codes 
There is evidence of the impact of building codes on innovation outcomes (Peñasco et al. 2021).  Only 
two studies assessed competitiveness impacts (one identifying positive impacts and one negligible ones) 
and three studies identifying distributional impacts, all positive.  

Overall, the evidence on the impact of the market pull policy instruments covered in Section 16.4.4.4 
when it comes to the competitiveness outcome (at least in the short term) is more mixed. For some of 
them, the evidence of a positive impact on innovation is more consistent than the others (for carbon 
taxes or FITs, for example). Peñasco et al (2021) found that the disagreements in the evidence regarding 
the positive, negative or no impact of a policy on competitiveness or distributional outcomes can often 
be explained by differences in policy design, differences in geographical or temporal context (since the 
review included evidence from countries from all over the world), or on how policy mixes may have 
affected the ability of the research design of the underlying papers to separate the impact of the policy 
under consideration from the others. 

16.4.4.5  Assessment of the impact on innovation, competitiveness and distributional outcomes of 

regulatory policy instruments targeting efficiency improvements 

There  is  medium  evidence  that  the  introduction  of  flexible,  performance-based  environmental 
regulation  on  energy  efficiency  in  general  (e.g.,  efficiency  standards)  can  stimulate  innovative

responses  in  firms  (Ambec  et  al.  2013;  Popp  2019)  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement).  Evidence 
comes  from  both  observational  studies  that  examine  patenting,  R&D  or  technological  responses  to 
regulatory interventions, and from surveys and qualitative case studies in which firms report regulatory 
compliance as a driving force for the introduction of environmentally-beneficial innovations (Grubb et 
al. 2021). While the literature examining the impact of environmental regulation on innovation is large, 
there have been fewer studies on the innovation effects of minimum energy or emissions performance 
regulations  specifically  relating  to  climate  mitigation.  We  discuss  in  turn  two  types  of  efficiency 
regulations: on vehicles, and on appliances.  

Relationship between automotive efficiency regulations and innovation 
The announcement, introduction and tightening of vehicle fleet efficiency or GHG emission standards 
either  at  the  national  or  sub-national  level  positively  impacts  innovation  as  measured  by  patents 
(Barbieri  2015)  or  vehicle  characteristics  (Knittel  2011;  Kiso  2019)  as  summarised  in  a  review  by  
Grubb et al (2021). Detailed studies on the innovation effects of national pollutant (rather than energy) 
regulations on automotive innovation also indicate that introducing or tightening performance standards 
has driven technological change (Lee et al. 2010). Some studies in the US that examine periods in which 
little regulatory change took place have found that the effects of performance standards on fuel economy 
have been small (Knittel 2011) or not significant relative to the innovation effects of prices (Crabb and 
Johnson 2010). This is at least in part because ongoing efficiency improvements during this period were 
offset by increases in other product attributes. For example, Knittel (2011) study observed that size and 
power increased without a corresponding increase in fuel consumption. It has also been observed that 
regulatory  design may  introduce  distortions that  affect automotive innovation  choices:  in  particular, 
fuel economy standards based on weight classes have been observed to distort light-weighting strategies 
for fuel efficiency in both China (Hao et al. 2016) and Japan (Ito and Sallee 2018).  

A  number  of  studies  have  focused  on  the  impacts  of  a  sub-national  technology-forcing  policy:  the 
California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate. When it was introduced in 1990, this policy required 
automotive firms to ensure that 2% of the vehicles they sold in 1998 would be zero emissions. In the 
years immediately after introduction of the policy, automotive firms reported that it was a significant 
stimulus to their R&D activity in electric vehicles (Brown et al. 1995). Quantitative evidence examining 
patents  and  prototypes  has  indicated  that  the  stringency  of  the  policy  was  a  significant  factor  in 
stimulating innovation, though this was in part dependent on firm strategy (Sierzchula and Nemet 2015). 
Like  in  the  previous  instruments,  most  of  the  evidence  comes  from  industrialised  countries  and 
additional research on other countries would be beneficial. 

Relationship between appliance efficiency standards and innovation 
Regulation-driven deployment of existing technologies can generate innovation in those technologies, 
through learning-by-doing, induced R&D and other mechanisms, although not in all cases (Grubb et al. 
2021)  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  The  introduction  or  tightening  of  minimum  energy 
performance  standards  for  appliances  (and  in  the  case  of  Noailly  (2012)  for  buildings)  have  driven 
innovation  responses,  using  direct  measures  of  product  attributes  (Newell  et  al.  1999)  and  patents 
(Noailly  2012;  Kim  and  Brown  2019),  though  not  all  studies  have  found  a  significant  relationship 
(Girod et al. 2017). There is also evidence of a correlation between regulation-driven deployment of 
energy-efficient products with accelerated learning in those technologies (Van Buskirk et al. 2014; Wei 
et al. 2017).  

In addition to observational studies, evidence on the relationship between innovation and regulation 
comes from surveys in which survey respondents are asked whether they have engaged in innovation 
leading to energy saving or reduced GHG emissions, and what the motivations were for such innovation. 
Survey  evidence  has found  that expected  or  current  regulation can drive both  R&D  investment  and 
decisions to adopt or introduce innovations that reduce energy consumption or CO2 emissions (Horbach 
et al. 2012; Grubb et al. 2021). Survey-based studies, however, tend not to specify the type of regulation.

Competitiveness  and  distributional  impacts  associated  with  vehicles  and  appliance  performance 
standards 
Minimum energy performance standards and appliance standards have been known to result in negative 
distributional impacts (limited evidence, medium/high agreement). Several studies focused on the US 
have highlighted that minimum energy performance standards for vehicles tend to be regressive, with 
poorer  households  disproportionately  affected  (Levinson  2019;  Jacobsen  2013),  particularly  when 
second-hand vehicles are taken into account (Davis and Knittel 2019). Similar arguments, though with 
less evidence, have been made for appliance standards (Sutherland 2006).  

Overall,  the  extent  to  which  regulations  in  energy  efficiency  result  in  positive  or  negative 
competitiveness impacts in firms is mixed (limited evidence, high disagreement). A meta-analysis of 
107 studies, of which 13 focused on regulations relating to energy consumption or GHG emissions, 
found that around half showed that regulations resulted in competitiveness impacts, while half did not 
(Cohen and Tubb 2018). Cohen and Tubb (2018) also found that studies examining performance-based 
regulations were less likely to find positive competitiveness impacts than those that examined market-
based instruments.  

Insights  into  causal  mechanisms  and  co-evolutionary  dynamics  from  case  studies  on  efficiency 
regulations 
While most of the literature addresses the extent to which regulation can induce innovation, a number 
of  case  studies  highlight  that  innovation  can  also  influence  regulation,  as  the  costs  of  imposing 
regulation  are  reduced  and  political  interests  emerge  that  seek  to  exploit  competitive  advantages 
conferred by successfully developing energy-efficient or low-carbon technologies (medium evidence, 
high  agreement).  Case  studies  map  the  causal  mechanisms  relating  regulations  and  innovation 
responses in specific firms or industries (Ruby 2015; Wesseling et al. 2015; Kemp 2005; Gann et al. 
1998). 

16.4.4.6  Assessment  of  the  impact  on  innovation  and  on  competitiveness  and  distributional 

outcomes of soft instruments 

Energy labels and innovation 
The  literature  specifically  focusing  on  the  impacts  of  labels  is  very  limited  and  indicates  positive 
outcomes  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  Energy  labels  may  accompany  a  minimum  energy 
performance standard and the outcomes of these policies are often combined in literature (IEA 2015). 
But again, given the limited evidence more research is needed. Although there are many studies on 
energy efficiency more broadly and for both standards and labels, only eight studies specifically focus 
on labels. Furthermore, seven of them report positive outcomes and one negative outcomes. Six of the 
studies  used  qualitative  methods  mentioning  the  impacts  of  labelling  on  the  development  of  new 
products (Wiel et al. 2006). Research specifically comparing voluntary labels with other mechanisms 
found  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between  labels  and  the  number  of  energy-efficient 
inventions (Girod et al. 2017). More research is needed especially in developing countries that have 
extensive labelling programs in place, and also with quantitative methods, to develop evidence on the 
impacts  of  labelling  on  innovation.  Box  16.7  discusses  an  example  of  a  combination  of  policy 
instruments in China including labelling, bans and financial support.

Box 16.7  China Energy Labelling Policies, combined with sale bans and financial subsidies 

From  1970  to  2001,  China  was  able  to  significantly  limit  energy  demand  growth  through  energy-
efficiency programs. Energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) declined by approximately 
5% yr-1 during this period. However, between 2002 and 2005, energy demand per unit of GDP increased

on average by 3.8% yr-1. To curb this energy growth, in 2005, the Chinese government announced a 
mandatory goal of 20% reduction of energy intensity between 2006 and 2010 (Zhou et al. 2010; Lo 
2014). 

An Energy Labelling System was passed in 2004. It requires the manufacturers to provide information 
about  the  efficiency  of  their  electrical  appliances  to  consumers.  From  2004  to  2010,  23  electrical 
appliances  (including  refrigerators,  air  conditioners  and  flat-screen  TVs)  being  labelled  as  energy 
efficient with 5 different grades, with Grade 1 being the most energy efficient and grade 5 the least 
efficient. Any appliances with an efficiency grade higher than 5 cannot be sold in the market.  

In addition to providing information to consumers, the National Development Reform Commission, 
which  was  in  charge  of  designing  the  policies,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  launched  in  2009  the 
“energy-saving products and civilian-benefiting project” (Zhan et al. 2011). It covered air conditioners, 
refrigerators, flat panel televisions, washing machines, electrical efficient lighting, energy saving and 
new  energy  vehicles  with  the  energy  grades  at  1  or  2  and  it  consisted  of  financial  subsidies  for 
enterprises  producing  these  products.  The  standard  design  of  these  financial  subsidies  involved  the 
government paying for the price difference of energy efficiency products and general products. The 
manufacturers which produce the energy efficient products can get the financial subsidies directly from 
the government (Wang et al. 2017b).  

Before 2008, the market share of grade 1 and grade 2 air conditioners was about 5%, and about 70% of 
all air conditioners were grade 5 (the most inefficient). Driven by the financial subsidies, the selling 
price  of  the  highly  efficient  air  conditioners  became  competitive  with  that  of  the  general  air 
conditioners. Hence, the sales of energy efficient air conditioners increased substantially, making the 
market  share  of  air  conditioners  at  grade  1  and  2  to  be  about  80%  in  2010  (Wang  et  al.  2017b). 
According to the information from energy efficiency labelling management centre of China National 
Institute  of  Standardisation,  under the  energy label  system implemented 5  years ago, more than  1.5 
hundred  billion  kWh  power  was  saved  by  March  2010,  equivalent  to  more  than  60  million  tons  of 
standard coal, 1.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, and 60 tons of sulphur dioxide emissions 
(Zhan et al. 2011), which significantly contributed to energy saving goals of the 11th Five-Year Plan. 

END BOX 16.7 HERE 

Voluntary approaches and innovation 
Voluntary approaches have a largely positive impact on innovation for those that choose to participate 
(robust evidence, medium agreement). Research on voluntary approaches focuses on firms adopting 
voluntary environmental management systems that can be certified based on standards of the widely 
adopted  International  Standards  Organisation  (ISO  14001)  or  the  European  Union  Environmental 
Management and Auditing Scheme (EMAS), which is partly mandatory today. Out of 16 analyses, 70% 
report positive innovation outcomes in terms of patents, or product and process innovation. 17% report 
negligible impacts and 13% report negative impact. Positive innovation outcomes have been linked to 
firms’ internal resource management practices and were found to be strengthened in firms with mature 
environmental management systems and in the presence of other environmental regulations  (He and 
Shen 2019; Inoue et al. 2013; Li et al. 2019a). Overall, studies are concentrated in a few countries that 
do not fully capture where environmental management systems have been actually adopted (Boiral et 
al. 2018). There is a need for research in analyses of such instruments in emerging economies including 
China and India, and methodologically in qualitative and longitudinal analyses (Boiral et al. 2018).  

Competitiveness and distributional outcomes of soft instruments  
The  outcomes  for  performance  or  endorsement  labels  have  been  associated  with  positive 
competitiveness  outcomes  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Out  of  19  studies,  89%  report 
positive  impact  and  11%  negligible  impact.  Although  there  are  several  studies  analysing 
competitiveness related metrics, evidence on most individual metrics is sporadic, except for housing

premiums. A large number of studies quantitatively assessing competitiveness find that green labels in 
buildings  are  associated  with  housing  price  premium  in  multiple  countries  and  regions  (Fuerst  and 
McAllister  2011;  Kahn  and  Kok  2014;  Zhang  et  al.  2017).  32%  of  the  studies  were  qualitative, 
associating  appliance  labelling  programs  with  employment  and  industry  development  (European 
Commission  2018).  There  is  a  research  gap  in  analyses  of  developing  countries,  and  also  in 
quantitatively assessing outcomes beyond housing price premiums.  

A few studies on the distributional outcomes of voluntary labelling programs point to positive impacts 
(limited evidence, high agreement). All four studies focusing benefits for consumers and tenants, report 
positive impacts (Devine and Kok 2015). Although there are benefits for utilities and other stakeholders, 
more  research  is  needed  specifically  attribute  these  benefits  to  voluntary  labels  rather  than  energy 
efficiency programs in general.  

Voluntary  agreements  are  associated  with  positive  competitiveness  outcomes  (medium  evidence, 
medium agreement), 14 out of 19 evaluations identified were associated with positive outcomes while 
three were associated with negligible outcomes, and two with negative outcomes. Research found an 
increase in perceived firm financial performance (de Jong et al. 2014; Moon et al. 2014). Studies also 
show an association with higher exports as more environmentally conscious trade partners increasingly 
value environmental certifications (Bellesi et al. 2005). More research is needed to develop evidence 
on  metrics  of  competitiveness  besides  firms’  financial  performance,  and  especially  in  developing 
countries.  

Voluntary  agreements  are  associated  with  a  positive  impact  on  distributional  outcomes  (limited 
evidence,  high  agreement).  Five  studies,  mainly  using  qualitative  approaches,  report  a  positive 
association between a firm adopting an environmental management system and impacts on its supply 
chains. There is a need for more studies with quantitative assessments and geographical diversity. 

16.4.4.7  Summary  of  the  size  and  direction  of  the  evidence  of  all  policy  instrument  types  on 

innovation outcomes 

Positive impacts have been identified more frequently in some policies than in others. There is also a 
lot of variation in the density of the literature. Developing countries are severely underrepresented in 
the  decarbonisation  policy  instrument  evaluation  literature  aiming  to  understand  the  impact  on 
innovation. (high evidence, high agreement). 

Figure 16.2 below indicates the extent to which some decarbonisation policy instruments have been 
more or less investigated in terms of their impact on innovation outcomes as described in Table 16.9 
above. For example, it indicates the extent to which there has been a greater focus of evaluations of the 
impact of R&D investments, emissions trading schemes and voluntary approaches on innovation. It 
also shows a limited amount of evidence on procurement, efficiency obligations with tradeable green 
certificates (TGCs), building codes and auctions.

Policy instrument type

Figure 16.2 Number of evaluations available for each policy instrument type covered regarding their 
impact on innovation and direction of the assessment. The vertical axis displays the number of 
evaluations claiming to isolate the impact of each policy instrument type on innovation outcomes as listed 
in Table 16.9. The colour indicates whether each evaluation identified a positive impact on the innovation 
outcome (blue), the existence of a negative impact (in orange), and no impact (in grey). It builds on 
Peñasco et al (2021), Grubb et al (2021), Lilliestam et al (2021) and additional studies identified as part of 
these reviews. TGC stands for tradeable green certificates. TWC stands for tradeable white certificates. 

16.4.5   Trade instruments and their impact on innovation 

There has been a long interest on the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on domestic capacity 
on innovation and on environmental outcomes. This section does not cover the much larger body of 
evidence on the relationship between FDI and economic development and growth. 

Overall, research indicates that trade can facilitate the entrance of new technologies, but the impact on 
innovation is less clear (limited evidence, low agreement). A recent study indicates that for countries 
with  high  environmental  performance  FDI  has  a  negligible  impact  on  environmental  performance, 
while on the lower end of the spectrum (countries with a lower environmental performance) may benefit 
from FDI in terms of their environmental performance (Li et al. 2019b). One analysis on China links 
FDI  not  just  with  improved  environmental  performance  and  energy  efficiency  but  also  innovation 
outcomes in general (Gao and Zhang 2013). Other work links FDI with increased productivity across 
firms (not just those engaged in climate-related technologies) through spill-overs (Newman et al. 2015). 
In addition, Brandão and Ehrl (2019) indicate that productivity of the electric power industry is more 
influenced by the transfer of embodied technology from other industries than by investments of the 
power industry and that countries with high R&D stocks are the main sources of these international 
technology spillovers and that the source countries may also benefit from the spillover.

Other emerging work investigates the role of local content requirements on innovation outcomes and 
suggests that it can lead to increased power costs (negative distributional impacts) and the domestic 
innovation system benefits, measured by patents or exports are unclear if the policies are not part of a 
holistic and longer lasting policy framework (Probst et al. 2020).  

16.4.6  Intellectual property rights, legal framework and the impact on innovation 

Virtually  all  countries  around  the  world  have  instituted  systems  for  the  protection  of  creations  and 
inventions, known as Intellectual Property (IP) rights systems  (WIPO 2021). While several types of 
intellectual property exist – patents, copyright, design rights, trademarks, and more –, this section will 
focus on patents, as the most relevant property right for technological innovations (World Intellectual 
Property Organization 2008), and hence the most relevant for policy instruments in this context.  

Patent systems aim to promote innovation and economic growth, by stimulating both the creation of 
new  knowledge  and  diffusion  of  that  knowledge  (high  evidence,  high  agreement).  National  patent 
systems, as institutions, play a central role in theories on national innovation systems (high evidence, 
strong agreement). Patent systems are usually instituted to promote innovation and economic growth 
(Nelson  and  Mazzoleni  1996;  Machlup  and  Penrose  1950;  Encaoua  et  al.  2006).  Some  countries 
explicitly refer to this purpose in their law or legislation – for instance, the US Constitution states the 
purpose of the US IP rights system to “promote the progress of science and useful arts”. Patent systems 
aim  to  reach  their  goals  by  trying  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  creation  of  new  knowledge  and 
diffusion of that knowledge  (Scotchmer and Green 1990; Devlin 2010; Anadon et al. 2016b). They 
promote  the  creation  of  new  knowledge  (e.g.  technological  inventions)  by  providing  a  temporary, 
exclusive right to the holder of the patent, thus providing incentives to develop such new knowledge 
and helping parties to justify investments in research and development. They promote the diffusion of 
this  new  knowledge  via  the  detailed  disclosure  of  the  invention  in  the  patent  publication,  and  by 
enabling a ‘market for knowledge’ via the trading of patents and the issuance of licenses (Arora et al. 
2004). Although IP protections provide incentives to invest in innovation, they have the double effect 
of restricting the use of new knowledge by raising prices or blocking follow-on innovation  (Stiglitz 
2008; Wallerstein et al. 1993). National patent systems, as institutions, feature prominently in models 
and theories of National Innovation Systems (Edquist 1997; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005). 

The degree to which patent systems actually promote innovation is subject to debate. Patent protection 
has been found to have a positive impact on R&D activities in patent-intensive industries, but this effect 
was  found  to  be  conditional  on  access  to  finance  (Maskus  et  al.  2019).    Patents  are  believed  to  be 
especially important to facilitate innovation in selected areas like pharmaceuticals, where investments 
in developments and clinical trials are high, imitation costs are low, and there is often a 1:1 relationship 
between a patent and a product, referred to as a “discrete” product industry (Cohen et al. 2000). At the 
same  time,  there  is  an  increasing  body  of  theoretical  and  empirical  literature  that  suggests  that  the 
proliferation  of  patents  also  discourages  innovation  (medium  evidence,  low  agreement).  Theoretical 
contributions note that a too stringent appropriability regime may greatly limit the diffusion of advanced 
technological  knowledge  and  eventually  block  the  development  of  differentiated  technological 
capabilities  within  an  industry,  in  what  is  called  an  ‘appropriability  trap’  (Edquist  1997;  Klein 
Woolthuis et al. 2005). There has been a long-standing debate on the impact of patents and other IP 
rights on innovation and economic development (Hall and Helmers 2019; Machlup 1958). Jaffe and 
Lerner (2004) and Bessen & Meurer (2009) highlight how IP rights also hamper innovation in a variety 
of  ways.  Other  more  specific  contributions  in  the  literature  focus  on  specific  factors.  For  example, 
Shapiro  (2001)  discusses  patent  thickets,  where  overlapping  sets  of  patent  rights  mean  that  those 
seeking to commercialize new technology, need to obtain licenses from multiple patentees. Heller and 
Eisenberg (1998) argue that a ‘tragedy of the anticommons’ is likely to emerge when too many parties 
obtain the right to exclude others from using fragmented and overlapping pieces of knowledge, with

ultimately no one having the effective privilege of using the results of biomedical research. Reitzig et 
al.  (2007)  describe  the  damaging  effects  of  extreme  business  strategies  employing  patents,  such  as 
patent trolling.  

IP protection and enforcement in general may have different impacts on economic growth in different 
types  of  countries  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  There  has  been  a  significant  degree  of 
harmonisation and cooperation between national IP systems over time. The most recent milestone is the 
1994 WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) , 
entered into by all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and which sets down minimum 
standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of intellectual property as applied 
to nationals of other WTO member nations (WTO 1994). Developing countries successfully managed 
to include some flexibilities into TRIPS both in terms of timing of legislative reform and in terms of 
the content of the reforms. In an attempt to understand the effects of the introduction of TRIPS, Falvey 
et al. (2006) find that the effect of IP protection on growth is positively and significantly related to 
growth for low- and high-income countries, but not for middle-income countries. They argue that low-
income  countries  benefit  from  increased  technology  flows,  but  middle-income  countries  may  have 
offsetting losses from the reduced scope for imitation. Note that Falvey et al. (2006) do not break down 
their results in different technological areas and they do not focus on innovation, but instead growth. It 
has been argued that the increasingly globalised IP regime through initiatives like the TRIPS agreement 
will diminish prospects for technology transfer and competition in developing countries, particularly 
for several important technology areas related to meeting sustainable development needs (Maskus and 
Reichman 2017). 

In principle, patent holders are not required to take their protected invention into use, and neither have 
the  obligation  to  allow  (i.e.,  license)  others  to  use  the  inventions  in  question  (high  evidence,  high 
agreement). Studies have shown that the way patent holders use their patent differs considerably across 
industrial sectors: in pharmaceutics, patents are typically used to be the only producer of a certain good 
(and obtain monopoly rents), while in industries like computers, semiconductors, and communications, 
patents are often used to strengthen positions in cross-licensing negotiations and to generate licensing 
income (Cohen et al. 2000; Foray 2004). There are also companies that predominantly obtain patents 
for defensive reasons: they seek freedom to design and manufacture, and by owning a patent portfolio 
themselves, they hope to prevent that they become the target of litigation by other patent holders (Hall 
and Ziedonis 2001). Patents are often used strategically to impede the development and diffusion of 
competing, alternative products, processes or services, by employing strategies known as ‘blanketing’ 
and ‘fencing’ (Grandstrand 2000), although the research is not specific to the climate space. 

There are notable but specific exceptions to the general principle that patent holders are not obliged to 
license their patent to others. These exceptions include the compulsory license, Fair, Reasonable and 
Non-discriminatory  (FRAND)  policies,  and  statement  on  licences  of  right  (high  evidence,  high 
agreement). While patent holders are, as stated above, in principle free to choose not to license their 
innovation, there are three important exceptions to this. First, most national patent laws have provisions 
for  compulsory  licensing,  meaning  that  a  government  allows  someone  else  to  produce  a  patented 
product  or  process  without  the  consent  of  the  patent  holder,  or  plans  to  use  the  patent-protected 
invention itself (WTO 2020). Compulsory licenses may be issued in cases of public interest or events 
of abuse of the patent (Biadgleng 2009; World Intellectual Property Organization 2008). Compulsory 
licensing is explicitly allowed in the WTO TRIPS agreement, and its use in context of medicine (for 
instance to control diseases of public health importance, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria) is 
further  clarified  in  the  ‘DOHA  Declaration’  from  2001  (Reichman  2009;  WHO  2020).  Second, 
standard-setting organisations have policies to include patented inventions in their standards only if the 
patent holder  is  willing  to commit  FRAND licensing conditions for those  patents  (Contreras  2015). 
While a patent holder can still choose not to make such a commitment, by doing so, its patent is no

candidate  anymore  for  inclusion  in  the  standard.  In  the  (many)  fields  where  standards  are  of  key 
importance, it is very unusual for patent holders not to be willing to enter into FRAND commitments 
(Bekkers  2017).  Third,  when  a  patent  holder,  at  the  time  of  filing  at  the  patent  office,  opts  for  the 
“licence of right” regime, in return for reduced patent fees, it enters into a contractual agreement that 
obliges to license the patent to those that request it. While not all national patent systems feature this 
regime, it is a feature present in the new European Community patent (EPO 2017), and may therefore 
increase in importance.  

For a discussion on the impact of IPR on international technology diffusion, see Box 16.9 in Section 
16.5. 

16.4.7  Sub-national innovation policies and industrial clusters  

Research examining the impacts of sub-national policies on innovation and competitiveness is sporadic 
– regional variations have been quantitatively assessed in US or China, or with case studies in these and 
other countries. Research on wind energy in the United States, distributed PV balance of systems in 
China,  and  renewable  energy  technologies  in  Italy  have  found  that  policies  that  incentivised  local 
demand were associated with inducing innovation, measured with patents (Fu et al. 2018; Gao and Rai 
2019; Corsatea 2016). Different policies may have different impacts – for example, in the United States 
state-level tax incentives and subsidies induced innovation within the state; but for renewable portfolio 
standards policies in other states were associated with innovation, because of impact on demand, but 
own-state policies were not (Fu et al. 2018). Research has also noted that the outcomes of policy and 
regulation on innovation are spatially heterogenous, because of differences in local planning authorities 
and capabilities (Song et al. 2019; Corsatea 2016).  

Sub-national  deployment  policies  have  been  associated  with  different  impact  on  competitiveness 
metrics  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Research  on  green  jobs  show  positive  association 
between sub-national policies and green jobs or green firms at the metropolitan level as well as the state 
of provincial level, in both China and the United States (Yi 2013; Yi and Liu 2015; Lee 2017), while 
others find no impact of renewable portfolio standards on green job growth in the state (Bowen et al. 
2013).  Other  examples  of  competitiveness  are  in  the  impact  of  regional  green  industrial  policy  in 
Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul region in attracting auctioned contracts for wind energy (Adami et al. 2017) 
or  in  the  changes  in  net  positive  state  revenues  associated  with  removing  tax  incentives  for  wind 
producers in Idaho in the US (Black et al. 2014).  

Sub-national policies also directly support innovation and competitiveness through green incubators 
and direct grants or R&D funding for local companies working on clean energy, intending to promote 
local economic development (limited evidence, medium agreement). The literature on the impacts of 
such policies on innovation and competitiveness is sparse. Some case studies and program evaluation 
reports,  primarily  in  the  United  States,  have  identified  the  impacts  of  sub-national  policies  on 
competitiveness — for example, job creation from direct R&D funding in North Carolina  (Hall and 
Link  2015),  perceptions  for  local  industry  development  and  support  for  follow-on  financing  for 
companies receiving state-funded grants in Colorado (Surana et al. 2020b), and return on investments 
for the state in research and innovation spending from the New York state’s energy agency (NYSERDA 
2020).  There  is  a  general  paucity  of  metrics  on  innovation  and  competitiveness  for  systematic 
assessments of such programs in developed countries, and even more so in India and other developing 
countries where such programs have been increasing  (Surana et al. 2020a; Gonsalves and Rogerson 
2019).  

Although states and local governments increasingly support clean energy deployment as well as directly 
support  innovation  given  its  link  with  economic  development  goals,  there  is  a  lack  of  systematic 
research on the impacts of these policies at the subnational level. More research—both qualitative and

quantitative,  and  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries—is  needed  to  systematically  develop 
evidence on these impacts and to understand the reasons behind regional differences in terms of the 
type of policy as well as the capabilities in the region. 

16.4.8   System-oriented policies and instruments 

Although  previous  sections  summarised  the research disentangling  the  role  of individual  policies  in 
advancing or hindering innovation (as well as impacts on other objectives), other research has tried to 
characterise the impact of a policy mix on a particular outcome. Although the outcome studied was not 
innovation, but diffusion (technology effectiveness is in the set of criteria outlined above), it seems 
relevant  to  discuss  overall  findings.  Reviewing  renewable  energy  policies  in  nine  OECD  countries, 
research concludes that, over time, a broad set of policies characterized by a ‘balance’ metric has been 
put  in  place.  This  research  also  identifies  a  significant  negative  association  between  the  balance  of 
policies in renewable energy and the diffusion of total renewable energy capacity but no significant 
effect of the overall intensity (coded as the 46 weighted average of six indicators) on renewable capacity 
(Schmidt and Sewerin 2019), indicating that a neutral conception of balance across all possible policies 
may  not be desirable and that policy mix intensity by itself does not explain technology diffusion.  

A growing body of research aims to understand how different policies interact and how to characterise 
policy mixes (del Río and Cerdá 2017; del Río 2010; Howlett and del Rio 2015; Rogge and Reichardt 
2016).  The  empirical  impact  on  the  innovation  outcomes  is  not  yet  discussed.  A  more  detailed 
discussion of this literature is located in Chapter 13. 

An  emerging  stream  of  research  in  complex  systems has  suggested  that  relatively  small  changes  in 
policy near a possible tipping point in climate impacts in areas including changing strategies related to 
investments in innovation, could trigger large positive societal feedbacks in the long term (Farmer et 
al. 2019; Otto et al. 2020a). 

16.5 International technology transfer  and cooperation for transformative 

change 

This section covers international transfer and cooperation in relation to climate-related technologies, 
“the  flows  of  know-how,  experience  and  equipment  for  mitigating  and  adapting  to  climate  change 
amongst different stakeholders” (IPCC 2000) as well as innovation to support transformative change 
compared to the AR5 (IPCC 2014) and the SR1.5 (IPCC 2018a). This complements the discussion on 
international cooperation on science and technology in Chapter 14. 

This section first outlines the needs for and opportunities of international transfer and cooperation on 
low-emission technologies. It then describes the main objectives and roles of these activities, and then 
reviews  recent  institutional  approaches  within  and  outside  the  UNFCCC  to  support  international 
technology transfer and cooperation. Finally, it discusses emerging ideas on international transfer and 
cooperation on technology, and possible modifications to support the achievement of climate change 
and sustainable development goals, building up to Section 16.6.  

16.5.1  International  cooperation  on  technology  development  and  transfer:  needs  and 

opportunities 

With the submission of their NDCs as part of the Paris Agreement, most developing countries are now 
engaged  in  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation.  While  technology  is  seen  as  one  of  the  ‘means  of

implementation’  of  climate  action,  developing  countries  often  have  relatively  limited  technology 
innovation  capabilities,  which  requires  them  to  access  technologies  developed  in  higher-income 
countries with stronger innovation systems (Popp 2011; Binz et al. 2012; Urban 2018).  In many cases, 
these technologies require adaptation for the local context and needs (Sagar 2009; Anadon et al. 2016b), 
and, once again, innovation capabilities are required to suitably adapt these technologies for local use 
and  also  to  create  new  markets  and  business  models  that  are  required  for  successful  deployment 
(Ockwell et al. 2015; Ockwell and Byrne 2016; Sagar 2009). This can lead to dependencies on foreign 
knowledge  and  providers  (Ockwell  and  Byrne  2016),  negative  impacts  in  terms  of  higher  costs 
(Huenteler  et  al.  2016a),  and  balance  of  payments  constraints  and  vulnerability  to  external  shocks 
(Ebeling 2020). 

The climate technology transition can also yield other development benefits, for instance better health, 
increased  energy  access,  poverty  alleviation  and  economic  competitiveness  (Deng  et  al.  2018a), 
including  industrial  development,  job  creation  and  economic  growth  (Altenburg  and  Rodrik  2017; 
Porter and Van der Linde 1995; Lema et al. 2020; Pegels and Altenburg 2020) (See Section 16.6). The 
growing  complexity  of  technologies  and  global  competition  have  made  the  development  of  a 
technology  into  a  globalized  process  involving  the  flow  of  knowledge  and  products  across  borders 
(Koengkan et al. 2020; Lehoux et al. 2014). For instance, in production of electronics, Asian economies 
have captured co-location synergies and dominate production and assembly of product components, 
whereas  American  firms  have  adopted  “design-only”  strategies  (Tassey  2014).  In  the  context  of 
renewable energy technologies, “green global division of labour” has been observed, with countries 
specialising  in  investments  in  R&D,  manufacturing  or  deployment  of  renewables  (Lachapelle  et  al. 
2017). In the case of solar PV, for example, while many of the technical innovations emerged from the 
US, Japan and China emphasized the manufacture of physical modules (Deutch and Steinfeld 2013) 
(see also Box 16.4).  

Such globalization of production and supply chains opens up economic development opportunities for 
developing  countries  (Lema  et  al.  2020).  At  the  same  time,  not  all  countries  benefit  from  the 
globalisation of innovation, as barriers remain related to finance, environmental performance, human 
capabilities and cost (Egli et al. 2018; Weiss and Bonvillian 2013), with developing countries being 
particularly  disadvantaged  at  leveraging  these  opportunities.  The  gap  in  low-carbon  technology 
innovation between countries appears to have been reducing only amongst OECD countries (Yan et al. 
2017; Du and Li 2019; Du et al. 2019) and the lower-income countries are not able to benefit as much 
from  low-carbon technologies.  For  instance, in  the  case  of agriculture,  Fuglie  (2018)  notes  out  that 
international  R&D  spillovers  seem  to  have  benefited  developed  countries  more  than  developing 
countries. Gross et al (2018)also argue that the development timescales for new energy technologies 
can extend up to 70 years, even within one country, and recommend that innovation efforts be balanced 
between  on  the  one  hand  commercialising  already  low-emission  technologies  in  the  demonstration 
phase, and diffusing them globally, and on the other hand early-stage R&D spending.  

Thus  international  cooperation  on  technology  development  and  transfer  can  enable  developing 
countries  to  achieve  their  climate  goals  more  effectively,  while  also  addressing  other  sustainable 
development goals, taking advantage, where possible, of the globalization of innovation and production 
(Lema et  al.  2020).  Earlier  assessments  in the  AR5  and  SR1.5  have made  it clear that international 
technology transfer and cooperation could play a role in climate policy at both the international and the 
domestic policy level (IPCC 2018b; Stavins et al. 2014; Somanathan et al. 2014) and for low-carbon 
development at the regional level (Agrawala et al. 2014). The Paris Agreement also reflects this view 
by noting that countries shall strengthen cooperative action on technology development and transfer 
regarding two main aspects: 1) promoting collaborative approaches to research and development and 
2) facilitating access to technology to developing country Parties (UNFCCC 2015). Furthermore, both

in literature and in UNFCCC deliberations, South-South technology transfer is highlighted (Khosla et 
al. 2017) as a complement to the transfer of technology and know-how from North to the South.  

This  is  consistent  with  literature  that  suggests  that  GHG  mitigation  in  developing  countries  can  be 
enhanced by (1) technology development and transfer collaboration and a ‘needs-driven’ approach, (2) 
development  of  the  specific  types  of  capacity  required  across  the  entire  innovation  chain  and  (3) 
strengthening  of  the  coordination  and  agendas  across  and  between  governance  levels  (including 
domestic and international levels)  (Upadhyaya et al. 2020; Zhou 2019; Khosla et al. 2017). 

16.5.2  Objectives and roles of international technology transfer and cooperation efforts  

International  efforts  involving  technology  transfer  can  have  different  objectives  and  roles.  These 
include access to knowledge and financial resources as well as promotion of new industries in both the 
developed  and  recipient  country  (Huh  and  Kim  2018).  Based  on  an  econometric  analysis  of 
international technology transfer factors and characteristics of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) 
projects, Gandenberger et al (2016) find that complexity and novelty of technologies explain whether 
CDM project includes hardware technology transfer, and that factors like project size and absorptive 
capacity of the host country do not seem to be drivers. Halleck Vega and Mandel (2018) argue that 
‘long-term  economic  relations’,  for  instance  being  part  of  a  customs  union,  affects  technological 
diffusion  between  countries  for  the  case  of  wind  energy,  and  indicate  that  this  has  resulted  in  low-
income countries being largely overlooked.  

There  is  some  literature  studying  whether  technology  cooperation  could  complement  or  replace 
international cooperation based on emission reductions, such as in the Kyoto Protocol, and whether that 
would  have  positive  impacts  on  climate  change  mitigation  and  compliance.  A  handful  of  papers 
conducted  game-theoretic  analysis  on  technology  cooperation,  sometimes  as  an  alternative  for 
cooperation  on  emission  reductions,  and  found  partially  positive  effects  (Rubio  2017;  Narita  and 
Wagner  2017;  Bosetti  et  al.  2017;  Verdolini  and  Bosetti  2017).  However,  Sarr  and  Swanson 
(2017)model that, due to the rebound effect, technology development and transfer of resource-saving 
technologies may not lead to envisioned emission reductions.  

While  technology  cooperation  can  be  aimed  at  emission  reduction  through  mitigation  projects,  as 
indicated above, not all cooperative actions directly result in mitigation outcomes. Overall, technology 
transfer  broadly  has  focused  on  i)  enhanced  climate  technology  absorption  and  deployment  in 
developing countries and ii) enhanced RD&D through cooperation and knowledge spill-overs.  

16.5.2.1  Enhancing low-emission technology uptake in developing countries 
Real-world outcomes in terms of low-emission technology deployment in developing countries may 
vary  significantly  depending  on  both  the  nature  of  the  international  engagement  and  the  domestic 
context. While there have been some success in the enhancement of technology deployment through 
technology transfer in some developing countries (de la Tour et al. 2011; Zhang and Gallagher 2016), 
many  others,  and  particularly  least-developed  countries,  are  lagging  behind  (Glachant  and 
Dechezleprêtre  2017).  They  indicate  that  this  is  due  to  the  lack  of  participation  in  economic 
globalisation  and  that  climate  negotiations  could  facilitate  technology  transfer  to  those  countries 
through  the  creation  of  global  demand  for  low-emission  technologies  through  stronger  mitigation 
targets  that  will result  in  lowering  of  costs and therefore  enhanced  technology diffusion.  A  broader 
perspective presents a host of other factors that govern technology diffusion and commercialization in 
developing  countries,  including,  investment;  social,  cultural  and  behavioural,  marketing  and  market 
building; macroeconomics; and support policy (Bakhtiar et al. 2020). Ramos Mejía et al (2018) indicate 
that the governance of  low-emission  technology transfer  and  deployment in  developing countries  is 
frequently negatively affected by a mixture of well- and ill-functioning institutions, in a context of, for 
instance,  market  imperfection,  clientelist  and  social  exclusive  communities  and  patrimonial  and/or

marketized states. Furthermore, existing interests, such as fossil fuel production, may also impede the 
deployment  of  low-emission  technologies,  as  highlighted  in  case  studies  of  Vietnam  and  Indonesia 
(Dorband  et  al.  2020;  Ordonez  et  al.  2021).  It  is  for  such  reasons  that  both  domestic  efforts  and 
international engagement are seen as necessary to facilitate technology transfer as well as deployment 
in developing countries (Boyd 2012).  The same has been seen as true in the case of agriculture where 
the very successful international research efforts of the CGIAR (with remarkably favourable benefit-
cost ratios (Alston et al. 2021) were complemented by the national agricultural research systems for 
effective uptake of high-yielding varieties of crops (Evenson and Gollin 2003).  

One  key  area  for  underpinning  effective  technology  uptake  in  developing  countries  relates  to 
capabilities for managing technological change that includes the capabilities to innovate, implement, 
and undertake integrated planning. There is much research to indicate that the ability of a country’s 
firms to adopt new technologies is determined by its absorptive capacity, which includes its own R&D 
activities, human capacity (e.g., technical personnel), government involvement (including institutional 
capacity), and the infrastructure in the country (Kumar et al. 1999), and that knowledge and capacity 
are part of the ‘intangible assets’ or the ‘software’ of a firm or a country (Corsi et al. 2020; da Silva et 
al. 2019; Ockwell et al. 2015). For sustainable development, capacity to plan in an integrated way and 
implement the SDGs (Elder et al. 2016; Khalili et al. 2015), including using participatory approaches 
(Disterheft et al. 2015), are conditional means of implementation. It also is argued that, if human capital 
were at the focus of international climate negotiations as well as national climate policy, it could change 
the political economy in favour of climate mitigation, which is needed for developing such capabilities 
in advance to keep up with the required speed of transformation  (Hsu 2017; Upadhyaya et al. 2020; 
Ockwell et al. 2015; IPCC 2018b). Halleck-Vega et al (2018), in a global analysis of wind energy using 
econometric  analysis,  lend  quantitative credibility to the  claim that  a technology  skill  base is a  key 
determinant  of  technological  diffusion.  Activities  to  enhance  capabilities  include  informational 
contacts, research activities, consulting, education & training and activities related to technical facilities 
(Huh and Kim 2018; Khan et al. 2020).  

There are multiple studies drawing on empirical work also support this conclusion. For South-South 
technology transfer between India and Kenya, not just technical characteristics, but also mutual learning 
on how to address common problems of electricity access and poverty, was suggested as an important 
condition  for  success  (Ulsrud  et  al.  2018).  Specifically  for  Africa,  Olawuyi  (2018)discusses  the 
capability gap in Africa, despite decades of technology transfer efforts under various mechanisms and 
programmes of the UNFCCC. The study suggests that barriers need to be resolved by African countries 
themselves, in particular inadequate access to information about imported climate technologies, lack of 
domestic capacities to deploy and maintain imported technologies, the weak regulatory environment to 
stimulate clean technology entrepreneurship, the absence or inadequacy of climate change laws, and 
weak  legal  protection  for  imported  technologies.  Moreover,  Ziervogel  et  al  (2021)  indicate  that  for 
transformative adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and capacity building shifting “the co-creation 
of contextual understandings” instead of top-down transferal of existing knowledge would deliver better 
results. Despite the understanding of the importance of the capacity issue, significant gaps still remain 
on this front (Technology Executive Commitee 2019); see also 16.5.4).  

16.5.2.2  Enhancing RD&D and knowledge spill-overs 
As  mentioned  earlier,  RD&D  can  aid  both  the  development  of  new  technologies  as  well  as  their 
adoption for new use contexts. Therefore it is not surprising that international cooperation on RD&D is 
identified  as  a  mechanism  to  promote  low-carbon  innovation  (see,  for  example,  Suzuki  (2015), 
Technology Executive Committee (2021), Mission Innovation (2019)). This has resulted in a variety of 
international initiatives to cooperate on technology in order to create knowledge spill-overs and develop 
capacity. For example, the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, amongst other things, aims to facilitate 
finance for RD&D of climate technologies by helping with readiness activities for developing country

actors.  In  particular  preparing  early-stage  technologies  for  a  smoother  transition  to  deployment  and 
commercialisation  has  been  emphasised  in  the  context  of  the  Technology  Executive  Committee 
(Technology Executive Committee 2017). There are numerous programmes, multilateral, bilateral and 
private,  that  have  facilitated  RD&D,  biased  mostly  towards  mitigation  (as  opposed  to  adaptation) 
activities,  and  many  programmes  that  seemed  to  be  about  RD&D  were  in  reality  dialogues  about 
research coordination (Ockwell et al. 2015). There also are a variety of possible bilateral and multilateral 
models  and  approaches  for  engaging  in  joint  R&D  (Mission  Innovation  2019).  An  update  by  the 
Technology  Executive  Committee  (2021)  reviewing  good  practices  in  international  cooperation  of 
technology  confirmed  the  conclusions  of  Ockwell  et  al(2015),  and  moreover  highlighted  that  most 
initiatives  are  led  by  the  public  sector,  and  that  the  private  sector  tended  to  get  involved  only  in 
incubation, commercialisation and diffusion phases. It also concluded that, although participation of 
larger, higher-income developing countries seems to have increased, participation of least-developed 
countries is still very low. 

16.5.3  International 

technology 

transfer  and  cooperation:  recent 

institutional 

approaches 

In the sections below, the literature on various categories of international technology cooperation and 
transfer is discussed.  

16.5.3.1  UNFCCC technology and capacity building institutions 
Technology development and transfer are a part of the UNFCCC since its agreement in 1992 and has 
undergone discussions and developments in the context of the international climate negotiations ever 
since, as assessed in AR5 (Stavins et al. 2014). The support on "Technology Needs Assessment" to 
developing  countries  was  the  first  major  action  undertaken  by  the  UNFCCC,  and  has  undergone 
different cycles of learning (Nygaard and Hansen 2015; Hofman and van der Gaast 2019). Since 2009, 
the UNFCCC discussions on technology development and transfer have focussed on the Technology 
Mechanism under the Cancun Agreements of 2010, which can be seen as the global climate governance 
answer to redistributive claims by developing countries  (McGee and Wenta 2014). The Technology 
Mechanism consists of a Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and a Climate Technology Centre 
and Network (CTCN). An independent review of CTCN evaluated it on five dimensions – relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, impacts and sustainability – indicated that the organization is achieving its 
mandate in all these dimensions, although there are some possible areas of improvement. The review 
also specifically noted that “the lack of predictability and security over financial resources significantly 
affected the CTCN’s ability to deliver services at the expected level, as did the CTCN’s lack of human 
and organizational resources and the capacity of NDEs.” (Technology Executive Committee 2017). The 
CTCN has overcome some of the limitations imposed by resource constraints by acting as a matchmaker 
from an open-innovation perspective (Lee and Mwebaza 2020). The lack of financial sustainability of 
the  CTCN  has  been  a  recurring  issue,  which  may  potentially  be  resolved  by  deepening  the  linkage 
between the CTCN and GCF (Oh 2020). In the meanwhile, the GCF is planning to establish the Climate 
Innovation Facility to support and accelerate early-stage innovations and climate technologies through 
the establishment of regional innovation hubs and climate accelerators as well as a climate growth fund 
(Green Climate Fund 2020). 

The ‘technology’ discussion has been further strengthened by the Paris Agreement, in which Article 10 
is  fully  devoted  to  technology  development  and  transfer  (UNFCCC  2015).  However,  the  political 
discussions around technology continue to be characterised by viewing technology mostly as hardware 
(Haselip et al. 2015), and relatively limited in scope (de Coninck and Sagar 2017). The workplans of 
the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the CTCN do, however, indicate a broadening of the 
perspective on technology (CTCN 2019; Technology Executive Commitee 2019).

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Since the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been operational, studies have 
assessed its hypothesised contribution to technology transfer, including transfer of knowledge. Though 
not  an  explicit  objective  of  the  CDM,  numerous  papers  have  investigated  whether  CDM  projects 
contribute to technology transfer (Michaelowa et al. 2019). The literature varies in its assessment. Some 
find extensive use of domestic technology and hence lower levels of international technology transfer 
(Doranova et al. 2010), while other indicate that around 40% of projects feature hardware or other types 
of international transfer of technology (Murphy et al. 2015; Seres et al. 2009), depending on the nature 
of technology, the host country and region (Cui et al. 2020) and the project type (Karakosta et al. 2012). 
Although the CDM would generally be positively evaluated on the technology transfer contribution, it 
was  also  regarded  critically  as  the  market-responsiveness  and  following  of  export  implies  a  bias  to 
larger,  more  advanced  economies  rather  than  those  countries  most  in  need  of  technology  transfer 
(Gandenberger  et  al.  2016),  although  some  countries  have  managed  to  correct  that  by  directing  the 
projects,  sub-nationally,  to  provinces  with  the  greatest  need  (Bayer  et  al.  2016).  Also,  the  focus  on 
hardware transfer of technology in evaluations of technology transfer under the CDM has been criticised 
(Michaelowa et al. 2019; Haselip et al. 2015). Indeed, although many studies do go beyond hardware 
in their evaluations (e.g. Murphy et al (2015)), the degree to which the project leads to a change in the 
national  system  of  innovation  or  institutional  capacity  development  is  not  commonly  assessed,  or 
assessed as limited (de Coninck and Puig 2015).  

There is significantly less literature on capacity building under the UNFCCC, especially as it relates to 
managing the technology transition. D’Auvergne and Nummelin (2017)(D´Auvergne and Nummelin 
2017), in a legal analysis, indicate the nature, scope and principles of Article 11 on capacity building of 
the  Paris  Agreement  as  being  demand-  and  country-driven,  following  a  needs  approach,  fostering 
national, subnational and local ownership, and being iterative, incorporating the lessons learned, as well 
as  participatory,  cross-cutting  and  gender-response.  They  also  highlight  that  it  is  novel  that  least-
developed  countries  and  SIDS  are  called  out  as  the  most  vulnerable  and  most  in  need  of  capacity 
building,  and  that  it  raises  a  “legal  expectation”  that  all  parties  “should”  cooperate  to  enhance  the 
capacity in developing countries to implement the Paris Agreement. These aspects are reflected in the 
terms of reference of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB) that was established in 2015 
at the 21st Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC 2016; D´Auvergne and Nummelin 2017), which was 
extended by five years at the 25th Conference of the Parties in 2019 (UNFCCC 2020a,b). In its work 
plan for 2020-2024, amongst other things, it aims to “identifying capacity gaps and needs, both current 
and emerging, and recommending ways to address them”.  

An  example  of  how  innovative  technologies  combined  with  capacity  development  and  institutional 
innovation is combined in the context of adaptation to extreme weather in SIDS can be found in Box 
16.8.

Box 16.8 Capacity building and innovation for early warning systems in Small Island 
Developing States 

One  of  the  areas  of  international  cooperation  on  capacity  building  is  adaptation,  which  has  been 
highlighted by both the Technology Executive Committee  (Technology Executive Committee 2015; 
Ockwell et al. 2015) and the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (UNFCCC 2020b) as an area where 
capacity gaps remain, especially in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  

While adaptation was initially conceived primarily in terms of infrastructural adjustments to long-term 
changes  in average conditions  (e.g.,  rising  sea  levels),  a  key  innovation  in  recent  years  has  been  to 
couple  such  long-term  risk  management  to  existing  efforts  to  manage  disaster  risk,  specifically 
including early warning systems enabling early action in the face of climate- and weather-risk at much

shorter  timescales  (e.g.,  IPCC  2012),  with  potentially  significant  rates  of  return  (e.g.,  Rogers  and 
Tsirkunov 2010; Hallegatte 2012; Global Commission on Adaptation 2019). 

to 

improvements 

In  recent  years,  deliberate  international  climate  finance  investments  have  focused  on  ensuring  that 
in 
developing  countries  (and  especially  SIDS  and  LDCs)  have  access 
hydrometeorological  observations,  modelling,  and  prediction  capacity,  sometimes  with  a  particular 
focus  on  the  people  intended  to  benefit  from  the  information  produced  (e.g.,  CREWS  2016).  For 
instance, on the Eastern Caribbean SIDS of Dominica, researchers took a community-based approach 
to identify the mediating factors affecting the challenges to coastal fishing communities in the aftermath 
of two extreme weather events (in particular hurricane Maria in 2017) (Turner et al. 2020). Adopting 
an adaptive capacity framework (Cinner et al. 2018), they identified ‘intangible resources’ that people 
relied on in their post-disaster response as important for starting up fishery, but also went beyond that 
framework to conclude that the response ability on the part of governmental organisations as well as 
other actors (e.g. fish vendors) in the supply chain is also a requirement for rebuilding and restarting 
income-generating  activity  (Turner  et  al.  2020).  Numerous  other  studies  have  highlighted  capacity 
building as adaptation priorities (Williams et al. 2020; Kuhl et al. 2020; Vogel et al. 2020; Basel et al. 
2020; Sarker et al. 2020).  

One  of  several  helpful  innovations  in  these  efforts  is  impact-based  forecasting  (Harrowsmith  et  al. 
2020),  which  provides  forecasts  targeted  at  the  impact  of  the  hazard  rather  than  simply  the 
meteorological variable, enabling a much easier coupling to early action in response to the information, 
enabling  a  more  appropriate  response  afterwards.  Automatic  responses  to  warnings  have  also  been 
adopted  in  the  humanitarian  field  for  anticipatory  action  ahead  (rather  than  simply  in  response  to) 
disasters triggered by natural hazards (Coughlan de Perez et al. 2015), resulting in a rapid scale-up of 
such  anticipatory  financing  mechanisms  to  tens  of  countries  over  the  past  few  years,  and  emerging 
evidence  of  its  effectiveness.  Still,  the  response  is  lacking  in  coherence  and  comprehensiveness, 
resulting  in  calls  for a  more  systematic  evidence  agenda  for anticipatory  action   (Weingärtner  et al. 
2020).  

END BOX 16.8 HERE 

From the  broader  assessment  above,  despite  limitations  of  available  information,  it  is  clear  that  the 
number of initiatives and activities on international cooperation and technology transfer and capacity 
building  seem  to  have  been  enhanced  since  both  the  Cancun  Agreements  and  the  Paris  Agreement 
(Technology  Executive  Committee  2021).  However,  given  the  complexity  and  magnitude  of  the 
requirements in terms of coverage of activities, the amount of committed funding, and effectiveness, 
much  more  can  be  done.  Some  assessments  of  UNFCCC  instruments  specifically  for  technology 
transfer to developing countries had indicated that functions such as knowledge development, market 
formation  and  legitimacy  in  developing  countries’  low-emission  technological  innovation  systems 
would need much more support to fulfil the Paris goals.  (de Coninck and Puig 2015; Ockwell et al. 
2015);  such  areas  would  benefit  from  continued  attention,  given  their  role  in  the  overall  climate 
technology transition.  

16.5.3.2  International RD&D cooperation and capacity building initiatives 
Besides  the  UNFCCC  mechanisms,  there  are  numerous  other  initiatives  that  promote  international 
cooperation on RD&D as well as capacity building. Some of them are based on the notion of “mission-
oriented innovation policy” (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017; Mazzucato 2018), which shapes markets 
rather than merely correcting market failures. 

For instance, “Mission Innovation” (MI) is a global initiative consisting of 23 member countries and 
the  European  Commission  working  together  to  reinvigorate  and  accelerate  global  clean  energy 
innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable with improved reliability and

secured supply of energy. The goal is to accelerate clean energy innovation in order to limit the rise in 
the global temperature to well below 2°C. The members to seek to increase public investments in clean 
energy R&D with the engagement of private sectors, and foster international collaboration amongst its 
members. A recent assessment shows that, although expenditures are rising, the aims are not met by 
2020  (Myslikova  and  Gallagher  2020).  Gross  et  al  (2018)caution  against  too  much  focus  on  R&D 
efforts for energy technologies to address climate change, including Mission Innovation.  They argue 
that given the timescales of commercialisation, developing new technologies now would mean they 
would  be  commercially  too  late  for  addressing  climate  change.  Huh  and  Kim  (2018)  discuss  two 
‘knowledge  and  technology  transfer’  projects  that  were  eventually  not  pursued  through  beyond  the 
feasibility  study  phase  due  to  cooperation  and  commitment  problems  between  national  and  local 
governments  and  highlight  the  need  for  ownership  and  engagement  of  local  residents  and  recipient 
governments. 

The intellectual property right regime (see Box 16.9) can be an enabler or a barrier to energy transition. 
For more background on IPR and impact on innovation, see Section 16.4.6.

Box 16.9 Intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes and technology transfer 

In the global context of climate mitigation technologies, it has been noted that technologies have been 
developed  primarily  in  industrialised  countries  but  are  urgently  required  in  fast-growing  emerging 
economies  (Dechezleprêtre  et  al.  2011).  International  technology  transfer  of  such  technologies  can 
primarily take place via three channels: (i) trade in goods, where technology is embedded in products; 
(ii)  direct  foreign  investments  (FDI),  where  enterprises  transfer  firm-specific  technology  to  foreign 
affiliates, and (iii) patent licenses, where third parties obtain the right to use technologies. IPRs are 
relevant for all these three channels. 

Not  surprisingly,  then,  the  role  of  IPRs  in  international  technology  transfer  of  climate  mitigation 
technologies  has  been  much  discussed  but  also  described  as  particularly  controversial  (Abdel-Latif 
2015).  The  relationships  between  IP  rights,  innovation,  international  technology  transfer  and  local 
mitigation and adaptation are complex (Maskus 2010; Li et al. 2020; Abdel-Latif 2015) and there is no 
clear  consensus  on  what  kind  of  an  IPR  regime  will  be  most  beneficial  for  promoting  technology 
transfer. 

Several  studies  argue  that,  particularly  in  developing  nations,  the  global  IP  regime  has  resulted  in 
delayed access, reduced competition and higher prices (Littleton 2008; Zhuang 2017) and that climate-
change-related  technology  transfer  is  insufficiently  stimulated  under  the  current  IPR  regime. 
Compulsory licensing (as already used in medicine) is one of the routes proposed to repair this (Abdel-
Latif 2015; Littleton 2008).  

There is little systematic evidence that patents and other IPRs restrict access to environmentally sound 
technologies,  since  these  technologies  mostly  are  in  sectors  based  on  mature  technologies  where 
numerous  substitutes  among  global  competitors  are  available  (Maskus  2010).  This  might  however 
change  in  the  future,  for  instance  with  new  technologies  based  on  plants,  via  biotechnologies  and 
synthetic fuels (Maskus 2010), for which Correa et al (2020) already find some evidence.  

There  also  is  literature  that  suggests  weak  IPR  regimes  have  a  “strong  and  negative  impact  on  the 
international  diffusion  of  patented  knowledge”  (Dechezleprêtre  et  al.  2013;  Glachant  and 
Dechezleprêtre  2017).  Also,  patents  may  support  market  transactions  in  technology,  including 
international  technology  transfer,  especially  to  “middle-income”  countries  and  larger  developing 
countries (Maskus 2010; Hall and Helmers 2019) but LDCs may be better served by building capacity 
to absorb and implement technology (Sanni et al. 2016; Hall and Helmers 2010; Maskus 2010; Glachant

and Dechezleprêtre 2017). It is also argued that it is not even clear that the patent system as it exists 
today is the most appropriate vehicle for encouraging international access (Sanni et al. 2016; Hall and 
Helmers  2010;  Maskus  2010;  Glachant  and  Dechezleprêtre  2017).  Given  the  large  variation  in 
perspectives on the role of IPRs in technology transfer, there is a need for more evidence and analysis 
to better understand if, and under what conditions, IPRs may hinder or promote technology transfer (see 
also Technology Executive Committee (2012)).    

In terms of ways forward to meet the challenge of climate change, different suggestions are made in the 
context of IPRs that can help to further improve international technology transfer of climate mitigation 
technologies,  including  through  the  TRIPS  agreement,  by  making  decisions  on  IPR  to  developing 
countries on a case-by-case basis, by developing countries experimenting more with policies on IPR 
protection, or through  brokering  or patent-pooling  institutions  (Littleton 2009;  Dussaux  et al. 2018; 
Maskus and Reichman 2017). Others also suggests that distinctions among country groups be made on 
basis  of  levels  of  technological  and  economic  development,  with  least  developed  countries  getting 
particular attention (Abbott 2018; Zhuang 2017).

16.5.4  Emerging ideas for international technology transfer and cooperation  

As with the broader innovation literature (as highlighted in Section 16.3), and, in fact, drawing on such 
literature,  there  has  been  an  emergence  of  a  greater  understanding  of,  and  emphasis  on,  the  role  of 
innovation  systems  (at  a  national,  sectoral,  and  technological  level)  as  a  way  to  help  developing 
countries with the climate technology transition (Technology Executive Committee 2015; Ockwell and 
Byrne 2016). This has given rise to several proposals, discussed here and summarised in Figure 16.3.  

Enhancing deployment and diffusion of climate technologies in developing countries would require a 
variety of actors with sufficient capabilities (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Ockwell et al. 2018; 
Kumar et al. 1999; Sagar et al. 2009). This may include strengthening existing actors (Malhotra et al. 
2021), supporting science, technology, and innovation-based start-ups to meet social goals (Surana et 
al 2020b), and developing entities and programs that are intended to address specific gaps relating to 
technology development and deployment (Ockwell et al. 2018; Sagar et al. 2009). 

There also is an increasing emphasis on the relevance of participative social innovation, local grounding 
and  policy  learning  as  a  replacement  of the  expert-led  technological change  (Kowarsch  et al.  2016; 
Chaudhary et al. 2012; Disterheft et al. 2015).  Others have suggested a shift to international innovation 
cooperation rather than technology transfer, which implies donor-recipient relationship. The notion of 
innovation  cooperation  also  makes  more  explicit  the  focus  on  innovation  processes  and  systems 
(Pandey  et  al.  2021).  A  broad  transformative  agenda  therefore  proposes  that  contemporary  societal 
challenges are complex and multi-variegated in scope and will require the actions of a diverse set of 
actors to both formulate and address the policy, implying social, institutional and behavioural changes 
next to technological innovations are the possible solutions (Geels 2004) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 
12 in this chapter). 

Several authors have proposed new mechanisms for international cooperation on technology. Ockwell 
and Byrne (2016) argue that a role for the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism could be to support climate 
relevant innovation-system builders (CRIBs) in developing countries, institutions locally that develop 
capabilities  that  “form the bedrock  of transformative,  climate-compatible, technological  change  and 
development”. Khan et al (2020) propose a specific variant with universities in developing countries 
serving as ‘central hubs’ for capacity building to implement the NDCs as well as other climate policy 
and planning instruments; they also suggest that developing countries outline their capacity building 
needs more clearly in their NDCs.

Building on an earlier discussion of technology-oriented and sectoral agreements (Meckling and Chung 
2009) and the potential for international cooperation in energy-intensive industry (Åhman et al. 2017), 
where  deep  emission  reduction  measures  require  transformative  changes  (see  also  Chapter  11), 
Oberthür et al (2021) propose that the global governance for energy-intensive industry through sub-
sector ‘clubs’ that include governmental, private and societal actors could be effective way forward 
(Oberthür et al. 2021).  

Examples  of  emerging  ideas  for  international  cooperation  on  climate  technology,  as  well  as  their 
relation  to  the  objectives  and  existing  efforts,  and  in  relation  to  the  level  of  development  of  the 
innovation system around a technology (Bergek et al. 2008; Hekkert et al. 2007) or in nations (Lundvall 
et al. 2009) are summarized in Figure 16.3.

16.6 Technological change and sustainable development 

This  section  considers  technological  innovation  in  the  broader  context  of  sustainable  development, 
recognising  that  technological  change  happens  within  social  and  economic  systems,  and  therefore 
technologies are conceived and applied in relation to those systems (Grübler 1998). Simplifications of 
complex interactions between physical and social systems and incomplete knowledge of technological 
innovation indirect effects may systematically lead to underestimation of environmental impacts and 
overestimation  of  our  ability  to  mitigate  climate  change  (Arvesen  et  al.  2011;  Hertwich  and  Peters 
2009).  

In previous sections, the chapter discussed how a systemic approach, appropriate public policies and 
international cooperation on innovation can enhance technological innovation. This section provides 
more details on how innovation and technological change, sustainable development and climate change 
mitigation intertwine. 

16.6.1  Linking sustainable development and technological change 

Sustainable development and technological change are deeply related (UNCTAD 2019). Technology 
has been critical for increasing productivity as the dominant driving force for economic growth but also, 
the concentration of technology in few hands has boosted consumption of goods and services which are 
not necessarily aligned with sustainable development goals (Walsh et al. 2020). It has been suggested 
that, in order to address sustainable development challenges, science and technology actors would have 
to change their relation to policymakers (Ravetz and Funtowicz 1999) as well as the public (Jasanoff 
2003). This has been further elaborated for the SDGs. The scale and ambition of the SDGs call for a 
change  in  development  patterns  that  require  a  fundamental  shift  in  both  current  best  practices  and 
guidelines  for  technological  and  investment  decisions  and  in  the  wider  socio-institutional  systems 
(UNCTAD  2019;  Pegels  and  Altenburg  2020).  This  is  needed  as  not  all  innovation  will  lead  to 
sustainable development patterns (Altenburg and Pegels 2012; Lema et al. 2015). 

Current Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) implementation gaps reflect, to some extent, inadequate 
understanding of the complex relationships among the goals (Skene 2020; Waiswa et al. 2019), as well 
as  their  synergies  and  trade-offs,  including  how  they  limit  the  range  of  responses  available  to 
communities  and  governments,  and  potential  injustices  (Thornton  and  Comberti  2017).  These 
relationships have been approached by focusing primarily on synergies and trade-offs while lacking the 
holistic perspective necessary to achieve all the goals (Nilsson et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2018). 

A  more  holistic  framework  could  envisage  the  SDGs  as  outcomes  of  stakeholder  engagement  and 
learning  processes  directed  at  achieving  a  balance  between  human  development  and  environmental 
protection (Gibbons 1999; Jasanoff 2003), to the extent that the two can be separated. From a science, 
technology and innovation (STI) perspective, Fu et al (2019) distinguish three categories of SDGs. The 
first  category  comprises  those  SDGs  representing  essential  human  needs  for  which  inputs  that  put 
pressure on sustainable development would need to be minimized. These include food (SDG 2), water 
(SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) resources, which continue to rely on production technologies and practices 
that are eroding ecosystem services, hampering the realization of SDG goals 15 (land) and 14 (oceans) 
(Díaz et al. 2019). The second are those related to governance and which compete with each other for 
scarce  resources,  such  as  infrastructure  (SDG  9)  and  climate  action  (SDG  13),  which  require  an 
interdisciplinary perspective. The third category are those that require maximum realization, include no 
poverty (SDG 1), quality education (SDG 4) and gender equality (SDG 5) (Fu et al. 2019). 

Resolving tensions between the SDGs requires adoption and mainstreaming of novel technologies that 
can  meet  needs  while  reducing  resource  waste  and  improving  resource-use  efficiency,  and  while 
acknowledging the systemic nature of technological innovation, which involve many levels of actors,

stages of innovation and scales (Anadon et al. 2016b). Changes in production technology have been 
found effective to overcome trade-offs between food and water goals (Gao and Bryan 2017). Innovative 
technologies at the food, water and energy nexus are transforming production processes in industrialized 
and developing countries, such as developments in agrivoltaics, which is co-development of land for 
agriculture  and  solar  with  water  conservation  benefits  (Barron-Gafford  et  al.  2019;  Schindele  et  al. 
2020;  Lytle  et  al. 2020),  and  other  renewably  powered  low-  to  zero-carbon food,  water  and energy 
systems (He et al. 2019). Silvestre and Ţîrcă (Silvestre and Ţîrcă 2019) indicate that maximising both 
social  and  environmental  aims  is  not  possible,  but  that  sustainable  innovations  include  satisfactory 
solutions for social, environmental and economic pillars (see Figure 16.4).  

Figure 16.4: Considerations and typology of innovations for sustainable development (Silvestre and Ţîrcă 
2019). 

There is evidence that technological changes can catalyse implementation of the reforms needed to the 
manner in which goods and services are distributed among people (Fu et al. 2019). A recently developed 
theoretical framework based on a capability approach (CA)  has been used to evaluate the quality of 
human life and the process of development (Haenssgen and Ariana 2018). Variations of the CA have 
been applied to exploratory studies of the link between technological change, human development, and 
economic  growth  (Mayer  2001;  Mormina  2019).  This  suggests  that  the  transformative  potential  of 
technology  as  an  enabling  condition  is  not  intrinsic,  but  is  assigned  to  it  by  people  within  a  given 
technological context. A failure to recognize and account for this property of technology is a root cause

of many failed attempts at techno-fixing sustainable development projects (Stilgoe et al. 2013; Fazey et 
al. 2020). 

The  basic  rationale  for  governance  of  technological  change  is  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  an 
enabling environment for climate and SDG-oriented technological change (Avelino et al. 2019). Such 
an environment poses high demands on governance and policy to coordinate with actors and provide a 
direction for innovation and technological change. Cross-Chapter Box 12 illustrates how the dynamics 
of  socio-technical  transitions  and  shifting  development  pathways  towards  sustainable  development 
offer  options  for  policymakers  and  other  actors to  accelerate the  system  transitions  needed  for  both 
climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Governance interventions to implement the 
SDGs will need to be operationalized at sub-national, national and global levels and support integration 
of resource concerns in policy, planning and implementation (UNEP 2015; Williams et al. 2020).

Introduction:  Numerous  studies  suggest  that  transformational  changes  would  be  required  in  many 
areas of society if climate change is to be limited to 2°C warming or less. Many of these involve shifts 
to low carbon technologies, such as renewable energy, which typically involve changes in associated 
regulatory and social systems; others more explicitly concern behavioural shifts, such as towards plant-
based diets or cleaner cooking fuels, or, at the broadest level, a shift in development pathways. Chapter 
1 establishes an analytic framework focusing on transitions, which chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 further 
develop. In this cross-chapter box, we provide a complementary overview of the dynamics of different 
kinds of transformational changes for climate mitigation and sustainable development. We first focus 
on insights from socio-technical transitions approaches, and then expand to broader system transitions.   

Dynamics of socio-technical transitions: A large literature documents the processes associated with 
transformational changes in technology and the social systems associated with their production and use 
(Köhler et al. 2019; Geels 2019). Transformational technological change typically goes hand-in-hand 
with shifts in knowledge, behaviour, institutions, and markets (Markard et al. 2012, p. 956; Geels and 
Schot 2010); stickiness in these factors often keeps society “locked-in” to those technologies already in 
widespread use, rather than shift to new ones, even those that offer benefits (David 1985; Arthur 1994). 
Exceptions often follow consistent patterns (Unruh 2002; Geels 2002); since AR5 a growing number 
of scholars have suggested using these insights to design more effective climate policies and actions 
(Geels et al. 2017). Chapter 1 (see Section 1.7 and Figure 1.6) represents technology diffusion and a 
corresponding shift in policy emphasis as a continuous process; it is also useful to identify a sequence 
of distinct stages that typically occur, associating each stage with a distinct set of processes, challenges, 
and effective policies (Patt and Lilliestam 2018; Victor et al. 2019). Consistent with elsewhere in this 
report (section 5.5.2 and SM.5.5.3 in Chapter 5, and section 16.3 in Chapter 16), Cross-Chapter Box 12 
Figure  1  elaborates  four  distinct  stages.  Recognizing  that  even  transformative  technologies  will 
eventually be replaced with newer ones, the figure portrays these as occurring in a cycle.

Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 Stages of socio-technical transition processes 

The emergence stage is marked by experimentation, innovation in the laboratory, and demonstration in 
the  field,  to  produce  technologies  and  system  architectures  (Geels  2005a).  By  its  very  nature, 
experimentation includes both successes and failures, and implies high risks. Because of these risks, 
especially  in  the  case  of  fundamentally  new  technologies,  government  funding  for  research, 
development  and  demonstration  (RD&D)  projects  is  crucial  to  sustaining  development  (Mazzucato 
2015b).  

The second stage is early adoption, during which successful technologies jump from the laboratory to 
limited commercial application (Pearson and Foxon 2012). Reaching this stage is often described as 
crossing the “Valley of Death”, because the cost/performance ratio for these new market entrants is too 
low for them to appear viable to investors (Murphy and Edwards 2003). A key process in the early 
adoption  phase  is  induced  innovation,  a  result  of  incremental  improvements  in  both  design  and 
production processes, and of mass-production of a growing share of key components (Grubb et al. 2021; 
Nemet 2006). There is diversity across classes of technologies, and learning tends to occur faster for 
technologies that are modular (Wilson et al. 2020), such as photovoltaics, and slower for those that 
require site- or context-specific engineering, such as in the shift to low carbon materials production 
(Malhotra  and  Schmidt  2020).  Public  policies  that  create  a  secure  return  on  investment  for  project 
developers  can  lead  to  learning  associated  with  industry  expansion  (See  Chapter  16,  Figure  16.1); 
typically  these  are  economically  and  politically  viable  when  they  promote  growth  within  a  market 
“niche”,  causing  little  disruption  to  the  mainstream  market  (Roberts  et  al.  2018).  Direct  support 
mechanisms, including cross-subsidies, such as feed-in tariffs, and market quotas such as renewable 
portfolio  standards,  are  effective  (Patt  and  Lilliestam  2018;  Geels  et  al.  2017b;  see  Chapter  9  for 
assessment of early adoption policies in the building sector). The value of these policies is less in their 
immediate  emissions  reductions,  but  more  in  generating  the  conditions  for  self-sustaining 
transformational change to take place as technologies later move from niche to mainstream (Hanna and 
Victor 2021).  

The third stage, diffusion, is where niche technologies become mainstream, with accelerating diffusion 
rates (see Chapter 1, Sections 1.7 and 16.4), and is marked by changes to the socio-technical “regime”, 
including infrastructure networks, value chains, user practices, and institutions. This stage is often the 
most  visible  and  turbulent,  because  more  widespread  adoption  of  a  new  technology  gives  rise  to

structural changes in institutions and actors’ behaviour (e.g. increased adoption of smart phones to new 
payment systems and social media), and because when incumbent market actors become threatened, 
they often contest policies promoting the new technologies (Köhler et al. 2019). In the diffusion stage, 
policy emphasis is shifted from financial support during the early adoption stage, towards supporting 
regime-level factors needed to sustain, or cope with, rapid and widespread diffusion (Markard 2018). 
These factors and policies are context specific. For example, Patt et al. (Patt et al. 2019) document that 
the policies needed to expand residential charging networks for electric vehicles depend on the local 
structure of the housing market.  

The  fourth  stage  is  stabilisation,  in  which  the  new  technologies,  systems,  and  behaviours  are  both 
standardized and insulated from rebound effects and backsliding  (Andersen and Gulbrandsen 2020). 
Sectoral bans on further investment in high carbon technologies may become politically feasible at this 
point (Breetz et al. 2018; Economidou et al. 2020). The decline of previously dominant products or 
industries can lead to calls for policy-makers to help those negatively affected, enabling a just transition 
(Newell  and  Simms  2020;  McCauley  and  Heffron  2018).  Political  opposition  to  the  system 
reconfiguration  that  comes  with  integration  and  stabilization  can  also  be  overcome  by  offering 
incumbent actors an attractive exit strategy (de Gooyert et al. 2016). 

Because different sectors are at different stages of low-carbon transitions, and because the barriers that 
policies  need  to  address  are  stage-  and  often  context-specific,  effective  policies  stimulating  socio-
technical transitions operate primarily at the sectoral level (Victor et al. 2019). This is particularly the 
case  during  early  adoption,  where  economic  barriers  predominate;  during  diffusion,  policies  that 
address regime-level factors often need to deal with cross-sectoral linkages and coupling, such as those 
between power generation, transportation, and heating (Patt 2015; Bloess 2019; Fridgen et al. 2020). 
The entire cycle can take multiple decades. However, later stages can go faster by building on the earlier 
stages’ having taken place elsewhere. For example, early RD&D into wind energy took place primarily 
in Denmark, was followed by early adoption in Denmark, Germany, and Spain, before other countries, 
including  the  United  States,  India,  and  China  leapfrogged  directly  to  the  diffusion  stage  (Lacal-
Arántegui 2019; Chaudhary et al. 2015; Dai and Xue 2015). A similar pattern played out for solar power 
(Nemet 2019b). International cooperation, geared towards technology transfer, capacity and institution-
building, and finance, can help ensure that developing countries leapfrog to low-carbon technologies 
that have undergone commercialization elsewhere (Adenle et al. 2015; Fankhauser and Jotzo 2018)(see 
also Chapter 5, Box 5.9, Chapter 15, Section 15.5 and Section 16.5 in this chapter)..  

This report contains numerous examples of the positive feedbacks in the centre of Cross-Chapter Box 
12, Figure 1, predominantly arising during the early adoption and diffusion stages, and leading to rapid 
or  unexpected  acceleration  of  change.  Public  acceptance  of  alternatives  for  meat  leads  to  firms 
improving the products, increasing political and economic feedbacks (Chapter 5, Section 5.4, Box 5.5). 
Declining costs in solar and wind cause new investment in the power generation sector being dominated 
by those technologies, leading to increased political support and further cost reductions (Chapter 6). In 
buildings  (Chapter  9)  and  personal  mobility  (Chapter  10),  low-carbon  heating  systems  and  electric 
passenger  vehicles  are  gaining  public  acceptance,  leading  to  improved  infrastructure  and  human 
resources,  more  employment  in  those  sectors,  and  behavioural  contagion.  Some  have  argued  that 
technologies  cross  societal  tipping  points  on  account  of  these  feedbacks  (Obama  2017;  Sharpe  and 
Lenton 2021).  

Dynamics between enabling conditions for system transitions: Abson et al. (2017) argue that it is 
possible  to  make  use  of  “leverage  points”  inherent  in  system  dynamics  in  order  to  accelerate 
sustainability transitions. Otto et al. (2020b) argue that interventions geared towards the social factors 
driving  change  can  “activate  contagious  processes”  leading  towards  the  transformative  changes 
required  for  climate  mitigation.  These  self-reinforcing  dynamics  involve  the  interaction  of  enabling 
conditions including public policy and governance, institutional and technological innovation capacity,

behaviour change, and finance. For example, Mercure et al. (2018) simulated financial flows into fossil-
fuel  extraction,  and  showed  how  investors’  taking  into  account  transition  risk  in  combination  with 
technological innovation would lead to the enhancement of investments in low-carbon assets and further 
enhanced innovation. As another example, behaviour, lifestyle, and policy can also initiate demand-
side transitions (Chapter 5) (Tziva et al. 2020), such as with food systems (Rust et al. 2020) (Chapter 
7,  section  7.4.5),  and  can  contribute  to  both  resilience  and  carbon  storage  (Sendzimir  et  al.  2011) 
(Chapter 16, Box 16.5).  

In the urban context, the concept of sustainability experiments has been used to examine innovative 
policies and practices adopted by cities that have significant impact on transition towards low-carbon 
and  sustainable  futures  (Bai  et  al.  2010;  Castán  Broto  and  Bulkeley  2013).  Individual  innovative 
practices can potentially be upscaled to achieve low-carbon transition in cities (Peng and Bai 2018), 
leading  to  a  process  of  broadening  and  scaling  innovative  practices  in  other  cities  (Peng  et  al. 
2019). Such  sustainability  experiments  give  rise  to  new  actor  networks,  which  in  some  cases  may 
accelerate change, and in others may lead to conflict (Bulkeley et al. 2014). As in the diffusion phase 
in  Cross-Chapter  Box  12,  Figure  1,  contextual  factors  play  a  strong  role.  Examining  historical 
transitions to cycling across European cities, Oldenziel et al. (2016) found contextual factors including 
specific configurations of actors to lead to very different outcomes. Kraus and Koch  (2021) found a 
short-term  social shock  –  the  COVID  crisis  –  to  lead  to  differential increases  in  cycling  behaviour, 
contingent on other enabling conditions.    

Linking  system  dynamics  to  development  pathways  and  broader  societal  goals:  Transition 
dynamics  insights  can  be  broadened  to  shifting  development  pathways.  Development  paths  are 
characterised  by  particular  sets  of  interlinking  regime  rules  and  behaviours,  including  inertia  and 
cascading effects over time, and are reinforced at multiple levels, with varied capacities and constraints 
on local agency occurring at each level (Burch et al. 2014)(See also Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 
4).  This  is  also  observed  by  Schot  and  Kanger  (2018),  who  identify  a    needed  change  in  a  “meta-
regime”,  crossing  sectoral  lines  in  linking  value-chains  or  infrastructure  and  overall  development 
objectives. In the context of the UN climate change regime, international cooperation can bring together 
such best practices and lessons learnt (Pandey et al. 2021; Adenle et al. 2015). This is especially relevant 
for  developing  countries,  which  often  depend  on  technologies  and  financial  resources  from  abroad, 
witnessing  their  pace  and  direction  influenced  by  transnational  actors  (Bhamidipati  et  al.  2019; 
Marquardt  et  al.  2016),  and  benefiting  little  in  terms  of  participating  in  high  value-added  activities 
(Whittaker et al. 2020).  

System transitions differ according to context, such as across industrialized and developing countries 
(Ramos-Mejía et al. 2018), and within countries. Lower levels of social capital and trust negatively 
impact niche commercialization (Lepoutre and Oguntoye 2018). In contexts of poverty and inequality, 
stakeholders’ – including users’ – capabilities for meaningful participation are limited and transition 
outcomes can end up marginalizing or further excluding social groups (Osongo and Schot 2017; Hansen 
et  al.  2018).  Many  studies  of  transitions  in  developing  countries  make  note  of  the  importance  of 
innovation  in  the  informal  sector  (Charmes  2016,  Box  5.10).  Facilitating  informal  sector  access  to 
renewable  energy  sources,  safe  and  sustainable  buildings,  and  finance  can  advance  low-carbon 
transitions (McCauley et al. 2019; Masuku and Nzewi 2021). Contrary, disregarding its importance can 
result  in  misleading  or  ineffective  innovation  and  climate  strategies  (Maharajh  and  Kraemer-Mbula 
2010; Mazhar and Ummad 2014; de Beer et al. 2016; Masuku and Nzewi 2021).  

Policies  shifting  innovation  in  climate-compatible  directions  can  also  reinforce  other  development 
benefits,  for  instance  better  health,  increased  energy  access,  poverty  alleviation  and  economic 
competitiveness (Deng et al. 2018b; Karlsson et al. 2020; IPCC 2018a). Development benefits, in turn, 
can create feedback effects that sustain public support for subsequent policies and hence help to secure 
effective  long-term  climate  mitigation  (Meckling  et  al.  2015b;  Geels  2014b;  Schmidt  and  Sewerin

2018;  van  Welie  and  Romijn  2018;  Herslund  et  al.  2018)  and  addressing  negative  socio-economic 
impacts (Eisenberg 2019; McCauley and Heffron 2018; Henry et al. 2020a; Deng et al. 2018b).  

Summary and gaps in knowledge: Strategies to accelerate climate mitigation can be most effective at 
accelerating and achieving transformative change when they are synchronized with transition processes 
in  systems.  They  address  technological  stage  characteristics,  take  advantage  of  high-leverage 
intervention points, and respond to societal dynamics (Abson et al. 2017; Köhler et al. 2019; Geels et 
al.  2017).  Gaps  in  knowledge  remain  on  how  to  tailor  policy  mixes,  the  interaction  of  enabling 
conditions, the generalizability of socio-technical transition insights to other types of systems, and how 
to harness these insights to better shift development pathways.

16.6.2  Sustainable development and technological innovation: Synergies, trade-offs and 

governance  

16.6.2.1  Synergies and trade-offs 

Policies that shift innovation in climate compatible directions can promote other development benefits, 
for instance better health, increased energy access, poverty alleviation and economic competitiveness 
(Deng et al. 2018a, see also Cross-Chapter Box 12). Economic competitiveness co-benefits can emerge 
as  climate  mitigation  policies  trigger  innovation  that  can  be  leveraged  for  promoting  industrial 
development,  job  creation  and  economic  growth,  both  in  terms  of  localizing  low-emission  energy 
technologies value chains as well as of increased energy efficiency and avoided carbon lock-ins (Section 
16.4). However, without adequate capabilities, co-benefits at the local level would be minimal, and they 
would probably materialize far from where activities take place (Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021; 
Ockwell and Byrne 2016). Innovation and technological change can also empower citizens. Grass-roots 
innovation promotes the participation of grass-roots actors, such as social movements and networks of 
academics, activists and practitioners, and facilitate experimenting with alternative forms of knowledge 
creation (UNCTAD 2019; Seyfang and Smith 2007). Examples of ordinary people and entrepreneurs 
adopting  and  adapting  technologies  to  local  needs  to  address  locally  defined  needs  have  been 
documented in the development literature (van Welie and Romijn 2018) (See also Box 16.10). Digital 
technologies can empower citizens and communities in decentralized energy systems contributing not 
only to a more sustainable but also to a more democratic and fairer energy system (Van Summeren et 
al. 2021) (See also Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter, and Section 5.4 in Chapter 5).  

Therefore,  even  though  STI  is  an  explicit  focus  of  SDG  9,  it  is  in  fact  an  enabler  of  most  SDGs 
(UNCTAD  2019).  Striving  for  synergies  between  innovation  and  technological  change  for  climate 
change  mitigation  with  other  SDGs  can  help  to  secure  effective  long-term  climate  mitigation,  as 
development benefits can create feedback effects that sustain public and political support for subsequent 
climate mitigation policies (Meckling et al. 2015a; Geels 2014a, also Cross-Chapter Box 12). However, 
innovation is not always geared to sustainable development, for instance, firms tend to know how to 
innovate when value chains are left intact  (Hall and Martin 2005), which tend to not be the case in 
systemic transitions. 

A  comprehensive  study  of  these  effects  distinguishes  among  “…anticipated-intended,  anticipated-
unintended,  and  unanticipated-unintended  consequences”  (Tonn  and  Stiefel  2019).  Theoretical  and 
empirical  studies  have  demonstrated  that  unintended  consequences  are  typical  of  complex  adaptive 
systems,  and  while  a  few are  predictable, a  much larger  number  are not  (Sadras  2020).  Even  when 
unintended consequences are unanticipated, they can be prevented through actor responses, for instance 
rebound  effects  following  the  introduction  of  energy  efficient  technologies.  Other  examples  of

unintended consequences include worse-than-expected physical damage to infrastructure and resistance 
from communities in the rapidly growing ocean renewable energy sector (Quirapas and Taeihagh 2020), 
and  gaps  between  expected  and  actual  performance  of  building  integrated  photovoltaic  (BIPV) 
technology (Boyd and Schweber 2018; Gram-Hanssen and Georg 2018).  In the agricultural sector, new 
technologies and associated practices that target the fitness of crop pests have been found to favour 
resistant variants. Unintended consequences of digitalisation are reported as well (Lynch et al. 2019) 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter). 

Innovation and climate mitigation policies can also have negative socio-economic impacts and not all 
countries,  actors  and  regions  around  the  world  benefit  equally  from  rapid  technological  change 
(UNCTAD 2019; Eisenberg 2019; McCauley and Heffron 2018; Henry et al. 2020b; Deng et al. 2018a). 
In fact, socio-technical transitions often create winners and losers (Roberts et al. 2018). Technological 
change can reinforce existing divides between women and men, rural and urban populations, and rich 
and poor communities, as older workers displaced by technological change will not qualify for jobs if 
they were unable to acquire new skills, weak educational systems may not prepare young people for 
emerging  employment  opportunities,  and  disadvantaged  social  groups,  including  women  in  many 
countries, often have fewer opportunities for formal education (UNCTAD 2019; McCauley and Heffron 
2018).  That  is  a  risk  regarding  technological  change  for  climate  change  mitigation,  as  emerging 
evidence  suggests  that  the  energy  transition  can  create  jobs  and  productivity  opportunities  in  the 
renewable energy sector, but will also lead to job losses in fossil fuel and exposed sectors (Le Treut et 
al.  2021).  At  the  same  time  these  new  jobs  may  use  more  intensively  high-level  cognitive  and 
interpersonal  skills  compared  to  regular,  traditional  jobs,  requiring  higher  levels  of  human  capital 
dimensions such as formal education, work experience and on-the-job training (Consoli et al. 2016). 
Despite the empowerment potentials of decentralized energy systems, not all societal groups are equally 
positioned to benefit from energy community policies, with issues of energy justice taking place within 
initiatives,  between  initiatives  and  related  actors,  as  well  as  beyond  initiatives  (van  Bommel  and 
Höffken 2021; Calzadilla and Mauger 2018). 

The opportunities and challenges of technological change can also differ within country regions and 
between countries (e.g. Garcia-Casals et al. 2019). Within countries, Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 
(2021)  show  that,  in  the  absence  of  policies  and  capacity  building  activities  which  promote  local 
recruiting, a significant part of total benefits of  wind projects, especially high-income jobs and high 
value-added activities, is captured by already higher income regions. Between countries, developing 
countries usually have lower innovation capabilities, which means they need to import low-emission 
technology from abroad and are also less able to adapt these technologies to local conditions and create 
new markets and business models. This can lead to external dependencies and limit opportunities to 
leverage economic benefits from technology transfer (Section 16.5.1).  

This means that in countries below the technological frontier, the contribution of technological change 
to  climate  change  mitigation  can  happen  primarily  through  the  adoption  and  less  through  the 
development of new technologies, which can reduce potential economic and welfare benefits from rapid 
technological change (UNCTAD 2019). The adoption of consumer ICT technologies (Baller et al. 2016) 
or renewable energy technologies (Lema et al. 2021) cannot bring least developed economies close to 
the technological frontier without appropriate technological capabilities in other sectors and an enabling 
innovation system (UNCTAD 2019; Malhotra et al. 2021; Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021; Sagar 
and Majumdar 2014; Ockwell and Mallett 2012; Ockwell et al. 2018). It has been argued widely that 
both  hard  and soft  infrastructure,  as  well as  appropriate  policy  frameworks  and  capability  building, 
would  facilitate  developing  countries  engagement  in  long-term  technological  innovation  and 
sustainable industrial development, and eventually in achieving the SDGs (UNCTAD 2019; Ockwell 
and Byrne 2016; Altenburg and Rodrik 2017).

16.6.2.2  Challenges to governing innovation for sustainable development 

Dominant economic systems and centralized governance structures continue to reproduce unsustainable 
patterns of production and consumption, reinforcing many economic and governance structures from 
local through national and global scales  (Johnstone and Newell 2018). Technological change, as an 
inherently  complex  process  (Funtowicz  2020),  poses  governance  challenges  (Bukkens  et  al.  2020) 
requiring social innovation (Repo and Matschoss 2019) (See also Section 5.6 in Chapter 5, and Chapter 
13).  

Prospects for effectively governing SDG-oriented technological transformations require at a minimum 
balanced views and new tools for securing the scientific legitimacy and credibility to connect public 
policy  and  technological  change  in  our  society  (Sadras  2020;  Jasanoff  2018).  Many  frameworks  of 
governance  have  been  proposed,  such  as  reflexive  governance  (Voss  et  al.  2006),  polycentric 
governance (Ostrom 2010), collaborative governance (Bodin 2017), adaptive governance (Munene et 
al. 2018) and transformative governance (Rijke et al. 2013; Westley et al. 2013) (see also Chapters 13 
and 14).  

A  particular  class  of  barriers  to  the  development  and  adoption  of  new  technologies  comprises 
entrenched  power  relations  dominated  by  vested  interests  that  control  and  benefit  from  existing 
technologies (Chaffin et al. 2016; Dorband et al. 2020). Such interests can generate balancing feedbacks 
within  multi-level  social-technological  regimes  that  are  related  to  technological  lock-in,  including 
allocations of investment between fossil and renewable energy technologies (Unruh 2002; Sagar et al. 
2009; Seto et al. 2016). 

Weaker coordination and implementation capacity in some developing countries can undermine ability 
to  avoid  trade-offs  with  other  development  objectives,  like  reinforced  inequalities  or  excessive 
indebtedness and increased external dependency, and can limit the potential of leveraging economic 
benefits from technologies transferred from abroad (Section 16.5, Cross-Chapter Box 12). Van Welie 
and Romijn (2018) show that in a low-income setting the exclusion of some local stakeholders from the 
decision-making process may undermine sustainability transitions efforts. Countries with high levels of 
inequality  can  be  more  prone  to  elite  capture,  non-transparent  political  decision  making  processes, 
relations based on clientelism and patronage, and no independent judiciary (Jasanoff 2018), although 
in particular contexts, non-elites manage to exert influence (Moldalieva and Heathershaw 2020). The 
dominance of incumbents however implies that sustainable technological transitions could be achieved 
without  yielding  any  social  and  democratic  benefits  (Hansen  et  al.  2018).  In  the  cultural  domain,  a 
recurrent policy challenge that has been observed in most countries is the limited public support for 
development  and  deployment  of  low  carbon  technologies  (Bernauer  and  McGrath  2016).  The 
conventional approach to mobilizing such support has been to portray technological change as a means 
of minimizing climate change. Empirical studies show that simply reframing climate policy is highly 
unlikely to build and sustain public support (Bernauer and McGrath 2016). 

Finally,  there  is  a  link  between  social  and  technological  innovation;  any  innovation  is  grounded  in 
complex socio-economic arrangements, to which governance arrangements would need to respond (see 
Sections 5.5 and 5.6, Chapter 13, and Cross-Chapter Box  12 in this chapter). Social innovation can 
contribute to maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs in relation to technological innovation 
and other innovative practices, but for this to materialize, national, regional and local  circumstances 
need to be taken into account and, if needed, changed. Even in circumstances of high capabilities, the 
extent social innovation might help to promote synergies and avoid trade-offs is not easy to evaluate 
(Grimm et al. 2013).

16.6.3  Actions that maximise synergies and minimise trade-offs between innovation and 

sustainable development 

Technological innovation may bring significant synergy in pursuing sustainable development goals, but 
it may also create challenges to the economy, human well-being, and the environment (Thacker et al. 
2019; Schillo and Robinson 2017; Walsh et al. 2020). The degree of potential synergies and trade-offs 
among SDG differs from country to country and over time (see section 16.6.1.1). These potentials will 
depend  upon  available  resources,  geographical  conditions,  development  stage  and  policy  measures. 
Even  though  synergies  and  trade-offs  related  to  technological  innovation  have  received  the  least 
attention from researchers (Deng et al. 2018a), literature show that higher synergy was found where 
countries’ policies take into account the linkages between sectors (Mainali et al. 2018). For technology 
innovation  to  be  effective  in  enhancing  synergies  and  reducing  trade-offs,  its  role  and  nature  in 
production and consumption patterns, as well as in value chains and in the wider economy, requires 
clarification. Technology ownership and control together with its current orientation and focus towards 
productivity needs to be revised if a meaningful contribution to the implementation of the SDGs in a 
transformative  way  is  to  be  achieved  (Walsh  et  al.  2020).  Responsible  innovation,  combining 
anticipation,  reflexivity,  inclusion  and  responsiveness,  has  been  suggested  as  a  framework  for 
conducting innovation (Stilgoe et al. 2013). Also inclusive innovation (Hoffecker 2021) could make 
sure that unheard voices and interests are included in decision-making, and methods for this have been 
implemented in practice (Douthwaite and Hoffecker 2017).  

There  are  several  examples  on  how  to  maximize  synergies  and  avoid  or  minimize  trade-offs  when 
bringing technological innovation to the ground. When implementing off-grid solar energy in Rwanda, 
synergies were found between 80 of the 169 SDG targets, demonstrating how mainstreaming off-grid 
policies  and  prioritising  investment  in  the  off-grid  sector  can  realise  human  development  and  well-
being, build physical and social infrastructures, and achieve sustainable management of environmental 
resources (Bisaga et al. 2021). Another example is related to wind power in Northeast of Brazil where 
the creation of direct and indirect jobs has been demonstrated in areas where capabilities are high, as 
well as associated improvements in wholesale and retail trade and real estate activities, though this also 
emphasises  the  need  for  capacity  development  along  with  international  collaboration  projects 
(Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021). Other examples are studies raising awareness on solar energy 
and women empowerment (Winther et al. 2018) and recycling and waste (Cross and Murray 2018).   

Other actions with the potential to maximize synergies are those related to community or “grassroot” 
technological innovation. The importance of the link between technological innovation and community 
action and its contribution to sustainable development is usually underestimated, and requires further 
research  and,  most  importantly,  its  inclusion  in  the  political  agenda  on  sustainable  development 
(Seyfang and Smith 2007). On the other hand, when technological innovation occurs far from where is 
implemented and participation in the production, and hence training activities of local actors is minimal, 
co-benefits and synergies among SDGs are limited and usually far below expectations (Vasconcellos 
and  Caiado  Couto  2021;  Bhamidipati  and  Hansen  2021).  Actions  by  policymakers  that  safeguard 
environmental  and  social  aspects  can  boost  synergies  and  maximize  those  co-benefits  (Lema  et  al. 
2021). Given that technological change impacts countries, regions and social groups differently, just 
transition policies can be designed to ensure all regions and communities are able to take advantage of 
the energy and other transitions (Henry et al. 2020b; McCauley and Heffron 2018). 

Box 16.10 provides insights on how a systemic approach to technological innovation can contribute to 
reconcile synergies and trade-offs to achieve sustainable development and mitigation goals.

Box 16.10  Agroecological approaches: the role of local and indigenous knowledge and 
innovation 

Major improvements in agricultural productivity have been recorded over recent decades (FAO 2018a). 
However, progress has also come with social and environmental costs, high levels of greenhouse gas 
emissions and rising demand for natural resources (UNEP 2017; Bringezu 2019; UNEP 2013; Díaz et 
al. 2019; FAO 2018a).  

Trend analysis indicate that, of global demand for land, a large share is projected to be supplied by 
South America, in particular the Amazon (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011; TEEB 2018) and Chaco forests 
(Grau et al. 2015). In developing countries, land use change for satisfying international meat demand is 
leading to deforestation. In Brazil, the amount of GHG emitted only by the beef cattle sector represents 
65% of the emissions of the agricultural sector and 15% of the overall emissions of the country (May 
2019).  

Agricultural and food systems are complex and diverse; they include traditional food systems, mixed 
food systems and modern food systems (Pengue et al. 2018). Multiple forms of visible and invisible 
flows of natural resources exist in global food systems (Pascual et al. 2017; IPBES 2019; TEEB 2018).  

Technological practices, management and changes in the food chain could help adapt to climate change, 
reduce emissions and absorb carbon in the soils, thus contributing to carbon dioxide removal (IPCC, 
2018, 2019). A range of technologies can be implemented, from highly technological options such as 
transgenic crops resistant to drought (González et al. 2019), salt or pesticides resistance (OECD 2011b; 
Kim  and  Kwak  2020)  or  smart  and  4.0  agriculture  (Klerkx  et  al.  2019),  to  more  frugal,  low-cost 
technologies such as agroecological approaches adapted to local circumstances  (Francis et al. 2003; 
FAO 2018b). These agroecological approaches are the subject of this box.  

For developing countries, agroecological approaches could tackle both climate change challenges and 
food security (WGII-report, Chapter 5, Box 5.10). In SIDSs, they support livelihoods to develop local 
food value chains can promote sustainable management of natural resources, preserve biodiversity and 
help build resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters (FAO 2019). Other advantages of 
agroecological  practices  include  their  adaptation  to  different  social,  economic  and  ecological 
environments (Altieri and Nicholls 2017), the fact that they are physical and financial capital-extensive, 
and  are  well-integrated  with  the  social  and  cultural  capital  of  rural  territories  and  local  resources 
(knowledge, natural resources, etc.), without leading to technological dependencies (Côte et al. 2019).  

Agroecology is a dynamic concept that has gained prominence in scientific, agricultural and political 
discourses in recent years (Wezel et al. 2020; Anderson et al. 2021) (Chapter 7 - Agroecology (including 
Regenerative Agriculture); Chapter 5 WGII Box 5.10). There are different agroecological approaches, 
three of which will be briefly discussed here: agroecological intensification, agroforestry and biochar 
use in rice paddy fields.  

Agricultural intensification provides ways to use land, water and energy resources to ensure adequate 
food  supply  while  also  addressing  concerns  about  climate  change  and  biodiversity  (Cassman  and 
Grassini  2020).  The  term  ecological  intensification  (Tittonell  2014)  focuses  on  biological  and 
ecological processes and functions in agroecosystems. In line with the development of the concept of 
agroecology,  agroecological  intensification  integrates  social  and  cultural  perspectives  (Wezel  et  al. 
2015). Agroecological intensification (Mockshell and Villarino 2019) for sub-Saharan Africa aims to 
address both employment and food security challenges (Pretty et al. 2011; Altieri et al. 2015).  

Another  example  of  an  agroecological  approach  is  agroforestry.  Agroforestry  provides  examples  of 
positive agroecological feedbacks, such as ‘the regreening of the Sahel’ in Niger. The practice is based 
on the assisted natural regeneration of trees in cultivated fields, an old method which was slowly dying

out but which innovative public policies (the transfer of property rights over trees from the state to 
farmers) helped restore (Sendzimir et al. 2011).  

Rice paddy fields are a major source of methane. Climate change impacts and adaptation strategies can 
affect  rice  production  and  net  income  of  rice  farmers.  Biochar  use  in  rice  paddy  fields  has  been 
advocated as a potential strategy to reduce GHG emissions from soils, enhance soil carbon stocks and 
nitrogen retention, and improve soil function and crop productivity (Mohammadi et al. 2020). 

Contributions  of  indigenous  people  (Díaz  et  al.  2019),  heritage  agriculture  (Koohafkan  and  Altieri 
2010) and peasants agroecological knowledge (Holt-Giménez 2002) to technological innovation offer 
a wide array of options for management of land, soils, biodiversity and enhanced food security without 
depending on modern, foreign agricultural technologies  (Denevan 1995). In farming agriculture and 
food systems, innovation and technology based on nature could help to reduce climate change impacts 
(Griscom  et  al.  2017).  Evidence  suggests  that  there  are  benefits  to  integrating  tradition  with  new 
technologies in order to design new approaches to farming, and that these are greatest when they are 
tailored to local circumstances (Nicholls and Altieri 2018).

16.6.4  Climate change, sustainability development and innovation 

This section gives a synthesis of this chapter on innovation and technology development and transfer, 
connecting it to sustainable development.  

In conjunction with other enabling conditions, technological innovation can support system transitions 
to  limit  warming,  help  shift  development  pathways,  and  bring  about  new  and  improved  ways  of 
delivering goods and services that are essential to human well-being (high confidence). At the same 
time,  however,  innovation  can  result  in  trade-offs  that  undermine  both  progress  on  mitigation  and 
progress towards other sustainable development goals. Trade-offs include negative externalities such 
as  environmental  impacts  and  social  inequalities,  rebound  effects  leading  to  lower  net  emission 
reductions  or  even  increases  in  emissions,  and  increased  dependency  on  foreign  knowledge  and 
providers (high confidence). Digitalisation, for example, holds both opportunity for emission reduction 
and emission-saving behaviour change, but at the same time causes significant environmental, social 
and GHG impacts (high confidence).  

A  systemic  view  of  innovation,  that  takes  into  account  the  roles  of  actors,  institutions,  and  their 
interactions, can contribute to both enhanced understanding of processes and outcomes of technological 
innovation, and to interventions and arrangements that can help innovation. It can also play a role in 
clarifying  the  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  technological  innovation  and  the  SDGs.  Effective 
governance and policy, implemented in an inclusive, responsible and holistic way, could both make 
innovation  policy  more  effective,  and  avoid  and  minimise  misalignments  between  climate  change 
mitigation, technological innovation, and other societal goals (medium evidence, high agreement).  

A  special  feature  is  the  dynamics  of  transitions.  Like  other  enabling  conditions,  technological 
innovation  plays  both  a  balancing  role,  by  inhibiting  change  as  innovation  strengthens  incumbent 
technologies and practices, and a reinforcing role, by allowing new technologies and practices to disrupt 
the  existing  socio-technical  regimes  (high  confidence).  Appropriate  innovation  policies  can  help 
organise innovation systems better, while other policies (technology push and demand pull) can provide 
suitable  resources  and  incentives  to  support  and  guide  these  innovation  systems  towards  societally-
desirable outcomes, ensure the innovations are deployed at scale, and direct these dynamics not just 
towards system transitions for climate change mitigation, but also towards addressing other SDGs. This 
means taking into account the full life-cycle or value chain as well as analysis of synergies and trade-
offs.

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Against this backdrop, international cooperation on technological innovation is one of the enablers of 
climate action in developing countries on both mitigation and adaptation (high confidence). Experiences 
with international cooperation on technology development and deployment suggest that such activities 
are most effective when approached as “innovation cooperation” that engenders a holistic, systemic 
view of innovation requirements, is done in equitable partnership between donors and recipients, and 
develops local innovation capabilities (medium evidence, high agreement). 

Chapter  17,  in  particular  Section  17.4,  connects  technological  innovation  with  other  enabling 
conditions, such as behaviour, institutional capacity and multi-level governance, to clarify the actions 
that could be taken, holistically and in conjunction, to strengthen and accelerate the system transitions 
required to limit warming to be in line with the Paris Agreement and to place countries in sustainable 
development pathways.  

16.7 Knowledge gaps 

Filling gaps in literature availability, data collection, modelling, application of frameworks and further 
analysis  in  several  sectors will improve  knowledge  on  innovation  and  technology  development  and 
transfer, including R&D to support policy making in climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. 
These policies and related interventions need to benefit from data and methodologies for the ex-post 
evaluation of their effectiveness. 

This  section  addresses  identified  knowledge  gaps  related  to  what  extent  developing  countries  are 
represented in studies on innovation and technology development and transfer; to national contexts and 
local innovation capacity; to potential and actual contributions of businesses; to literature emphasis on 
mitigation; to indicators to assess innovation systems; to non-technical barriers for the feasibility of 
decarbonisation  pathways;  to  the  role  of  domestic  IPR  policy;  to  digitalisation  in  low-emissions 
pathways; to the compliance of Paris Agreement in regard to technology and capacity building. 

One of knowledge gap identified when assessing the literature is on the representation of developing 
countries  in  studies  on  innovation  and  technology  development  and  transfer.  This  includes  the 
conceptual  core  disciplines  of  the  economics  of  innovation,  innovation  systems  and  sustainability 
transitions. This goes both for studies on developing countries, and for authors originating from, or 
active  in,  developing  countries  contexts.  The  evidence  of  the  impact  of  decarbonisation  policy 
instruments applied to developing countries or SIDS is limited. Expanding the knowledge base with 
studies  with  a  focus  on  developing  countries  would  not  only  allow  for  testing  whether  the  theories 
(developed  by  predominantly  by  developed-country  researchers  for  industrialised  countries)  hold  in 
developing  country  contexts,  but  also  yield  policy  insights  that  could  help  both  domestic  and 
international policymakers working on climate-related technology cooperation. 

While a growing literature has shown how technology characteristics and complexity, national context 
and innovation capacity can influence the capacity of a country's innovation ecosystem as a result of 
incentive  and  attraction  policies,  more  research  is  needed  to  help  prioritise  and  design  policies  in 
different  national  contexts  while  filling  important  knowledge  gaps  regarding  the  impact  of  “green” 
public  procurement,  lending,  “green”  public  banking  and  building  code  policies  on  innovation 
outcomes. 

There  is  also  a  superficial  understanding  of  the  potential  and  actual  contributions  of  businesses, 
educational institutions and socially responsible programmes, particularly in developing countries, as 
sources of innovation and early adopters of new technologies, and a notable lack of knowledge about 
indigenous practices.

Chapter 16 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Besides  the  strong  bias  of  literature  to  studies  originating  from  and  based  on  developed  countries, 
innovation  and  technology  literature  is  also  skewed  to  mitigation,  and  within  mitigation  to  energy. 
Literature on technology innovation for adaptation is largely missing.  

In the area of innovation studies, data are limited on the different indicators used to assess the strength 
of  the  innovation  system,  even  for  energy,  including  global  figures  on  R&D  and  demonstration 
spending, also for developing countries, and their effectiveness. There is also a lack of a comprehensive 
framework  and  detailed  data  to  assess  the  strengths  of  low-emission  innovation  systems,  including 
interactions among actors, innovation policy implementation, and strength of institutions. 

Another gap in knowledge remains between the results from energy-climate-economy models and those 
emerging from systems transition and sustainability transition approaches, empirical case studies, and 
the  innovation  system  literature.  If  this  gap  is  filled,  the  understanding  of  the  feasibility  of 
decarbonisation pathways in light of the many non-technical barriers to technology deployment and 
diffusion could be improved.  

In the field of policy instruments, existing evaluations provide insufficient evidence to assess the impact 
of  decarbonisation  policy  instruments  on  innovation,  as  these  evaluations  mainly  focus  on 
environmental or technological effects. The potential positive or negative role of domestic IPR policy 
in  technology  transfer  to  least  developed  countries  remains  unclear  as  the  literature  does  not  show 
agreement.  Moreover,  gaps  remain  in  impact  evaluations  of  sub-national  green  industrial  policies, 
which are of growing importance. The interaction between subnational and national decarbonisation 
policies  to  advance  innovation  would  also  benefit  from  further  research,  particularly  in  developing 
countries. 

The understanding of the role of digitalisation in decarbonisation pathways is lacking and needs to be 
studied from several angles. Existing studies do not sufficiently take into account knowledge on the 
energy impact of digital technologies, in particular the increase in energy demand by digital devices, 
and  the  increase  in  energy  efficiency.  They  would  benefit  from  being  technology/sector/country-
specific.  

The way in which digitalisation will influence the framework conditions under which decarbonisation 
will occur, the socio-economic and behavioural barriers influencing the diffusion of technologies in the 
long-term scenarios and the relationship with society and its effects need to be further explored. 

Given the implications of the digital revolution for sustainability, a better characterisation of governance 
aspects would increase understanding of the implications and possibilities of digitalisation and other 
GPTs for policymakers.  

Relatedly, research (both theoretical and empirical) on the impacts of imitation, or adaptation of new 
technological solutions invented in one region and used in other regions, could fill knowledge gaps, in 
order to accelerate the diffusion of climate-related technologies, while taking care not to reduce the 
incentive for inventors to invest in the search for new solutions. 

Lastly,  an  independent  assessment  about  the  compliance  of  the  Paris  Agreement  with  regard  to 
technology  and  capacity  building  as  means  of  implementation  is  starting  under  the  Enhanced 
Transparency Framework for action and support, where a methodology of monitoring, reporting and 
verification are being developed.  There is also a lack of analysis of the full landscape of international 
cooperation, of what is needed to meet the objectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, and of 
its effectiveness.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

FAQ  16.1  Will  innovation  and  technological  changes  be  enough  to  meet  the  Paris  Agreement 
objectives?  

The Paris Agreement stressed the importance of development and transfer of technologies to improve 
resilience to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, innovation and even 
fast technological change will not be enough to achieve Paris Agreement mitigation objectives. Other 
changes  are  necessary  across  the  production  and  consumption  system  and  the  society  in  general, 
including behavioural changes.  

Technological changes never happen in a vacuum, they are always accompanied by, for instance, people 
changing  habits,  companies  changing  value  chains,  or  banks  changing  risk  profiles.  Therefore, 
technological  changes  driven  by  holistic  approaches  can  contribute  to  accelerate  and  spread  those 
changes towards the achievement of climate and sustainable development goals. 

In innovation studies, such systemic approaches are said to strengthen the functions of technological or 
national innovation systems, so that climate-friendly technologies can flourish. Innovation policies can 
help respond to local priorities and prevent unintended and undesirable consequences of technological 
change,  such  as  unequal  access  to  new  technologies  across  countries  and  between  income  groups, 
environmental degradation and negative effects on employment. 

FAQ  16.2  What  can  be  done  to  promote  innovation  for  climate  change  and  the  widespread 
diffusion of low-emission and climate-resilient technology? 

The  speed  and  success of  innovation  processes  could be  enhanced  with  the involvement  of a  wider 
range  of  actors  from  the  industry,  research  and  financial  communities  working  in  partnerships  at 
national, regional and international levels. Public policies play a critical role to bring together these 
different  actors  and  create  the  necessary  enabling  conditions,  including  financial  support  through 
different instruments as well as institutional and human capacities.  

The increasing complexity of technologies requires cooperation if their widespread diffusion is to be 
achieved. Cooperation includes the necessary knowledge flow between within and between countries 
and regions. This knowledge flow can take the form of exchanging experiences, ideas, skills, practices, 
among others. 

FAQ 16.3 What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change? 

Technologies that are currently known but not yet widely used need to be spread around the world, and 
adapted to local preferences and conditions. Innovation capabilities are required not only to adapt new 
technologies for local use but also to create new markets and business models. International technology 
cooperation can serve that purpose. 

In fact, evidence shows that international cooperation on technology development and transfer can help 
developing countries to achieve their climate goals more effectively, and if this is done properly can 
also help addressing other sustainable development goals. Many initiatives exist both regionally and 
globally to help countries in achieving technology development and transfer through partnerships and 
research  collaboration  that  include  developed  and  developing  countries,  with  a  key  role  for 
technological institutions and universities. Enhancing current activities would help an effective, long-
term global response to climate change, while promoting sustainable development.

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Globalization  of  production  and  supply  of  goods  and  services,  including  innovation  and  new 
technologies,  may  open  up  opportunities  for  developing  countries  to  advance  technology  diffusion; 
however, so far not all countries have benefited from the globalisation of innovation due to different 
barriers such as access to finance and technical capabilities. These asymmetries between countries in 
the globalization process can also lead to dependencies on foreign knowledge and providers.  

Not  all  technology  cooperation  directly  results  in mitigation  outcomes.  Overall,  technology transfer 
broadly  has  focused  on  enhancing  climate  technology  absorption  and  deployment  in  developing 
countries as well as RD&D and knowledge spill-overs. 

Paris Agreement also reflects this view by noting that countries shall strengthen cooperative action on 
technology  development  and  transfer  regarding  two  main  aspects:  1)  promoting  collaborative 
approaches to research and development and 2) facilitating access to technology to developing country 
Parties.
